<h1>Help - HMI Web Clients</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:<a name="Overview"></a></h2>

<p>This web based HMI system is an open system based on web standards. Therefore 
there are no hard and fast rules as to how an HMI may be built. It is possible 
to build a web based HMI using the HMI protocol using your own components and
without using any of the components described here. However, the software
components provided with the system make building an HMI faster and easier. 
This section concentrates on building a simple example.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Web Based Applications:<a name="Web Based Applications"></a></h2>

<p>There are two major types of web based applications. In the traditional type,
the control logic is all performed on the server, with the client (web browser) 
being limited to just displaying static HTML from the server. With this sort of 
application, updating any of the information on the client requires loading a new
web page from the server. This can be a compartively slow process which is not
suited to displaying rapidly changing information. 
</p>

<p> 
A newer type of web application,	often refered to as "AJAX" (Asynchronous Javascript 
And XML), has been developed however which solves this shortcoming. This uses the 
ability of the web browser to fetch new information from a server without reloading
the entire page. The result is the user will see the information on the page update
on a continuous basis without being interrupted for a page reload. 
</p>

<p>There are several means of accomplishing this reading of information. The one
most suited to industrial HMI applications is a Javascript function called 
"XMLHTTPRequest". Despite the name, XMLHTTPRequest can be used to fetch any 
sort of data, not just XML. In this HMI application, the protocol uses it to fetch
JSON encoded data.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Security and 'Same Origin':<a name="Security and 'Same Origin'"></a></h2>

<p>A web based HMI normally involves a web page and a web browser. The web 
browser will request the web page from a web server using what is referred 
to as an http "GET" operation. An AJAX application can then use 
XMLHTTPRequest to request updated information from the server using what are 
referred to as http "POST" operations ("GET" can also be used in some 
circumstances).
</p>

<p>Most web browsers however have a limitation which they impose for security
reasons. The limitation is that an AJAX client can only communicate with the
same server that the web page came from. This means it is not possible to fetch
web pages from one server (or open them from a local disk) and request data
from a different server. It also means that it is not possible for an HMI
application to fetch data from multiple sources simultaneously.
</p>

<p>This is not normally a serious limitation for most applications. Most HMI
applications will only need to interact with one server. If they do need 
information from several servers, then it is usually possible for one server
to fetch this information so the HMI client can read it from a single source.  
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Web Applications and Web Pages:
	<a name="Web Applications and Web Pages"></a></h2>

<p>The first step in building a web based HMI is creating a web page. A typical
HMI will consist of a single web page. The reason for this is that (again, for
security reasons) there is no simple way to pass information between web pages.
This means that code which is running in the context of one web page cannot
communicate with code which is running in the context of another web page. This
makes it difficult to create a web based HMI which consists of multiple pages.  
</p>

<p>A single web page does not however restrict you to a single HMI "screen".
It is possible to create multiple HMI "screens" on a single web page and then
hide all but one screen at a time. Each screen can then be revealed one at a 
time under program control, giving a form of navigation which is more like
a traditional non-web application.

<h2>CSS Styling:</h2>

<h3>Basic Page Layout:</h3>

	<p>The CSS style sheet for this example is shown below. The CSS styles used
	in your own project will be different, depending on what you want the display
	to look like. The important thing to notice here is how the "display" properties
	for mainscreen, eventscreen, and alarmscreen are set. "display" for mainscreen
	is set to "block" while the others (eventscreen and alarmscreen) are set to 
	"none". This means the main screen will be displayed when the page is loaded, 
	while the others will be hidden. These values are then changed through 
	Javascript to hide or reveal screens as required. Also, a fixed-width paged 
	design is used to control page presentation to make layout of graphical 
	screens easier.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	/* Page layout CSS for the HMI minimal demo demo. 
		This contains the CSS which controls the overall page layout
		and appearance, as well as the display of the navigation menu
		and the display of the different "screens".
	*/
	
	/* This controls the appearance of the area outside of the defined screens. */
	body,
	html {
		margin:0px;
		padding:0px;
		background:white;
		color:black;
		}
	/* This provides the background image. */
	body {
		min-width:1000px;
		min-height:600px;
		}
	
	/* This provides a filler strip between the nav menu and the main display area. */
	#filler {
		background:tomato;
		margin:0px auto;
		width:1000px;
		}
	
	
	/* This handles the navigation (menu) bar. */
	#nav {
		background:tomato;
		font-size: 150%;
		margin-top:0px;
		margin-bottom:0px;
		padding-bottom:2px;
		}
	#nav ul{
		padding-top:5px;
		padding-bottom:5px;
		list-style:none;
		}
	#nav li{
		display:inline;
		}
	
	#nav a {
		float:left;
		text-decoration:underline;
		color:white;
		background-color:grey;
		border-right:2px solid white;
		padding-top:2px;
		padding-bottom:2px;
		padding-left:5px;
		padding-right:5px;
		}
	#nav a:hover {
		background-color:green
		}
	
	
	
	/* This provides a filler strip at the bottom of the main display area. */
	#footer {
		background:tomato;
		clear:both;
		}
	#footer p {
		padding:5px;
		margin:0px;
		}
	
	/* This controls display of the main screen. */
	#mainscreen {
		background:bisque;
		width:1000px;
		display: block;
		}
	
	#mainscreen h2, #mainscreen h3, #mainscreen p {
		padding:0px 10px;
		}
	
	/* This controls display of the events screen. */
	#eventscreen {
		background:bisque;
		width:1000px;
		display: none;
		}
	#eventscreen h2, #eventscreen h3, #eventscreen p {
		padding:0px 10px;
		}
	
	/* This controls display of the alarms screen. */
	#alarmscreen {
		background:bisque;
		width:1000px;
		display: none;
		}
	#alarmscreen h2, #alarmscreen h3, #alarmscreen p {
		padding:0px 10px;
		}

	<h3>SVG Button Animation with CSS:</h3>

	<p>The SVG push buttons can be "animated" when they are "clicked" to give 
	immediate feedback to the user. The easiest way to do this is through CSS
	sytling. In the example below, we reverse the "stroke" property from
	black to white when the button is activated (clicked). This gives a very
	effective "flash" to the outline and lettering on the button without
	requiring any scripting. Other properties can also be used to give
	different effects.
	</p>

	<p>An alternate method using Javascript is described in the section on 
	the display libraries. 
	</p>

	<p>This example also uses "hover" to alter the stroke width when the mouse
	cursor hovers over the button. This gives the operator the "feel" that this
	object is special and is active.
	</p>

	<pre class="examples">

	/* The following style is used to animate SVG push buttons. It causes the 
		outline (stroke) of the button to reverse when activated. */
	.buttonactivate {
		stroke: black;
		stroke-width: 5px;
	}
	
	.buttonactivate:hover {
		stroke: black;
		stroke-width: 7px;
	}
	
	.buttonactivate:active {
		stroke: white;
		stroke-width: 5px;
	}
	
	</pre>
