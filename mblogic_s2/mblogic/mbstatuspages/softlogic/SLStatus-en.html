<h1>Help - Soft Logic Status</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>The soft logic IO configuration and the soft logic program can be monitored 
and modified by using the "Status" interface. The status interface allows the 
user to control and monitor the system through a web interface. The status 
interface has its own help pages which describe how to operate it. This page 
will just review the general capabilities.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Programming and Trouble Shooting:</h2>

<h3>Writing Programs:</h3>

<p>Soft logic programs are stored as instruction list (IL) plain text files. 
These files may be created or edited using the on-line editor built into the
status system. See the help sections on "System Status" for more information.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, since the files are plain text they may also be edited with 
any editor capable of using plain text files. 
</p>


<h3>Viewing Programs and Cross References:</h3>

<p>The status system also provides a web based interface for viewing programs
in IL and ladder formats. It also provides program cross references.
</p>

<hr>


<h2>Starting the Soft Logic Program:</h2>

<p>The soft logic program is started automatically when the system starts up. 
The file name is set in the soft logic IO configuration file (see the help
page on that topic for more details).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Reloading the Program:</h2>

<p>The soft logic program can be restarted and reloaded while the system is 
running by using the "Status" web interface. This does not reinitialise or 
change the values in the system data table or the soft logic data table. This
means that reloading the soft logic program (e.g. after making a change to it) 
is effectively a form of "on-line programming", because it permits a program 
to be changed while the system is running. 
</p>

<p><strong><em>It is important to remember though, that making a change to 
a running system may cause unexpected side effects. Be sure to exercise caution 
when using this feature.</em></strong>
</p> 

<p>"One shot" (differentiation) instructions may lose their previous state 
and re-initialise. This is because with the "Ck" logic library (as with the 
style of conventional PLCs on which it is modelled), the state of the 
instruction is held with the instructions themselves, and not in the normal 
data table. When the program is reloaded, the previous state of these 
instructions is lost.    
</p>

<p>The following items are changed when the program is reloaded: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The "first scan" flag is set to "true" ("1").</li>
	<li>The scan counter is reset to zero.</li>
	<li>The scan timers are reset to their default values.</li>
</ul>



<hr>

<h2>Viewing Data Table Contents:</h2>

<p>The "Status" interface provides a means of viewing the contents of any data
table address. See the status system documentation for more information. 
</p>
