<h1>Help - Soft Logic Programming</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>The purpose of a soft logic system is to run programs 
written in programming languages used by  PLCs. The following describes the
format and structure of these programs. 
</p>


<hr>

<h2>PLC Programming Languages:<a name="PLC Programming Languages"></a></h2>

<p>PLC programs are typically displayed in either ladder (LAD) or instruction list 
(IL). However what, a PLC or soft logic system actually executes is actually IL
(or something close to it). Ladder is simply a graphical means of displaying
IL.   
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Source File Format:<a name="Source File Format"></a></h2>
<p>The file format used is plain ASCII text files. These may
be created using the built in IL editing facilities in the status
system, or with any text editor capable of creating plain text files. </p>

<h3>File Format:</h3>
<p>Program source files must be in plain ASCII text with one instruction per 
line. Each line must be separated by a newline character. 
</p>


<h3>Intermediate Formats</h3>
<p>Although the soft logic system generates intermediate forms of the  
program before executing, these are not stored permanently. Only the plain 
source format is kept and used each time the system is started or the program 
reloaded. 
</p>

<h3>File Names</h3>
<p>The name of the file used to store the soft logic program source code is 
defined in the soft logic configuration system. See the documentation on 
that feature for more details on this subject. 
</p>

<h3>Number of Source Files</h3>
<p>A complete program must be in a single file, and this file must contain
all subroutines referenced by the program.   
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Program Symbols:<a name="Program Symbols"></a></h2>

<p>The following defines some general rules which must be followed when
writing soft logic programs.
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are defined by the comment symbol "//". The comment symbol must be
followed by a space. Comments must start at the beginning of a line. Anything 
following a comment symbol on the same line is ignored. 
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// This is a comment.
	// And this is another comment.

</pre>


<h3>Rungs or Networks</h3>
<p>PLC programs are normally separated into "rungs" or (in IEC terminology)  
"networks". In this soft logic system, a rung symbol is an instruction and 
executes code which prepares the system to execute the IL code contained in 
the rung and also stores diagnostic information.
</p>

<p>Rungs are normally numbered, although the rung numbers used can be arbitrary 
and in any order. They may even be duplicated. However, since the system stores 
the rung numbers to provide diagnostic information in the event of an error, it 
is normally advantageous to use unique, ordered rung numbers in a program. Empty 
rungs are permitted. 
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	NETWORK 14
	// This is a rung.
	STR X1
	AND C2
	OUT Y33
	
	NETWORK 15
	// This rung is empty.
	
	NETWORK 16
	// And this is another rung.
	STR X14
	OUT Y12

</pre>


<h3>Program Instructions</h3>
<p>Anything which is not a comment is treated as an instruction (including the 
start of rungs or networks). Instructions must follow these rules: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each instruction must start at the beginning of a line.</li>
	<li>There must be no more than one instruction per line.</li>
	<li>Parameters are separated from instructions by spaces.</li>
	<li>Everything on the same line following an instruction is considered to 
	be a parameter for that instruction.</li>
	<li>An instruction may be of any length, but must not contain spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each instruction must either have a unique symbol or be able to be uniquely 
identified by its parameter types. It must not rely on the context of other 
adjacent instructions to identify it. When an instruction is capable of accepting 
multiple incompatible parmeter types, each varient is considered to be a different 
instruction. When loading a soft logic program, the soft logic system will search its 
list of valid instructions for the first one which matches both the instruction 
symbol and the parameter types. If no match is found, it is considered to be an 
unknown instruction.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// This is just an example and may not match any particular PLC.
	// This is an instruction using a boolean variable.
	AND X1
	// This is a different instruction using a word variable.
	AND V10000
	// This is a different instruction using a pointer variable.
	AND P10000
	// This is a different instruction using a constant.
	AND K1234
	// This is an invalid instruction as the parmeter type does not match.
	AND R10.5

</pre>



<h3>Data Table Addresses</h3>
<p>The soft logic system treats all data table addresses as "labels". An address 
label is considered to be an arbitrary name with no significance other than 
as a unique identifier. This means that the soft logic system does not attempt 
to infer relationships between addresses based on any numbers contained in the 
address label. This allows the system to deal with different address formats 
without having to "understand" them.
</p>

<p>This also means however that addresses which may have the same "numerical" 
value but which are written differently are treated as differnt addresses. 
For example, "X1" and "X01" are considered to be different addresses. Therefore,
programs must be written to a single form of each address.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// This instruction is using a valid address.
	STR X1
	// The address used with this instruction is not recognised.
	STR X01

</pre>


<h3>Subroutines</h3>
<p>When the system starts to read in a soft logic program source file, the 
first instructions encountered are considered to be part of the "main" routine.
If no subroutine instruction is encountered, then the entire program is 
considered to be a single "main" routine. 
</p>

<p>The start of a subroutine is indicated by the "instruction" which defines
the start of a subroutine. All code following a subroutine instruction is
considered to be part of that subroutine until either a new subroutine
instruction is encountered, or until the end of the source file.                   
</p>

<p>This means that all subroutines must be at the end of a file, and that
subroutines may not be nested (you may not define a subroutine inside
another subroutine). 
</p> 

<pre class="examples">

	// This is the start of the main routine.
	NETWORK 1
	STR X1
	OUT Y1
	
	NETWORK 2
	// This calls a subroutine.
	STR X31
	CALL Sub1
	
	NETWORK 3
	// The program scan ends here.
	END
	
	// ################################
	SBR Sub1
	// This is a subroutine.
	NETWORK 1
	STR Y1
	AND Y2
	OUT C16
	RT
	
	// This is the end of the program.

</pre>

<h2>Ladder Representation:<a name="Ladder Representation"></a></h2>

<p>Soft logic programs can be displayed in either IL (instruction list) or 
ladder format (see the "Status System" for more details on this). The ladder 
display system will automatically convert IL logic into ladder format if it 
is possible to do so. However, since IL is more flexible than ladder, it is 
possible to write valid IL logic in a manner which cannot be converted into 
ladder (this is a problem common to all PLCs). When a rung of logic cannot 
be displayed as ladder, the system will default to displaying it in IL. 
</p>

<h3>Rules for Ladder Versus IL Display</h3>

<p>The following rules govern whether an IL program may be displayed in 
ladder format:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Output instructions may not be followed by input instructions
		in the same rung. A rung may contain more than one output instruction,
		but all inputs must precede any outputs. </li>
	<li>Any output instruction which takes more than one logic input (e.g.
		shift register, counters, etc.) must be the only output in the rung.</li>
	<li>There must be no more than 8 inputs in series. More than this will not
		fit on the page. </li>
	<li>Errors in the soft logic program created by the user may result in 
		logic cannot be displayed in ladder (as well as not executing correctly).
		</li>
</ol>

<p>When a rung cannot be displayed in ladder format, it will instead be 
displayed in IL. Each rung is dealt with individually, and problems with 
one rung will not affect subsequent rungs.
</p>

<h3>Ladder Versus IL Instructions</h3>

<p>Each individual ladder instruction is equivalent to a single IL instruction.
Ladder is simply an alternative way of representing IL. See the documenation
on instructions for more details. 
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>In IL format, comments may be inserted anywhere in a program. However, when 
the rung is displayed in ladder format, all comments are gathered together in
a block immediately below the start of the rung. This does not affect the 
file in which the program is stored. It only affects how the comments are 
displayed. All comments between the start of a rung (a NETWORK instruction)
and the start of the next rung (or subroutine) belong to that rung.  
</p>

<p>Any comments which exist between a subroutine definition (SBR instruction)
and the first rung in the subroutine are considered to belong to the subroutine
definition and are displayed there. Any comments which exist between the start 
of the program and the first rung are considered to belong to the main program, 
and are treated similarly. 
</p>

<h3>Unconditional Outputs</h3>

<p>Some instructions (e.g. RT - unconditional return from subroutine) are 
"unconditional". That is, they execute regardless of the current logic state.
If these instructions are inserted into a rung together with input instructions
and conditional outputs, they will attach themselves to the conditional outputs.
<em>However</em>, this does not affect how the unconditional instructions work.
They will continue to execute regardless of the logic state of the rest of the
rung. 
</p>

<h3>Name of Program</h3>

<p>The file name of the program is automatically inserted into the heading
of the main program. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example Program:<a name="Example Program"></a></h2>
<p>The following shows a simple program.
</p>



<p>Example: </p>
<pre class="examples">

	// Demo program for soft logic.
	NETWORK 1
	// This is a counter.
	STR X1
	STR SC1
	CNTU CT100 50
	
	NETWORK 2
	// This is a timer
	STR SC1
	TMR T5 329 ms
	
	STR T5
	OUT Y367
	
	NETWORK 3
	// This calls a subroutine.
	STR T5
	CALL Sub1
	
	NETWORK 4
	// This just executes some ladder logic.
	STR SC1
	ORN C2
	AND X17
	OUT Y1
	
	NETWORK 5
	END
	
	SBR Sub1
	// This is a subroutine.
	NETWORK 1
	STR SC1
	MATHDEC DS100 0 SQRT(DD1 + 25)
	
	NETWORK 2
	STRGE DS100 1
	OUT C50
	
	NETWORK 3
	RT

as a mixture of ladder and IL, as parts of the program were written in a
