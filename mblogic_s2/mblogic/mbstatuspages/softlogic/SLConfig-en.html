<h1>Help - Soft Logic Configuration</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>The soft logic system has its own data table which is independent of the 
main system (or communications) data table). The soft logic IO configuration 
provides the connection between the two data tables. Without a soft logic IO 
configuration, the soft logic program will run, but it will have no way to 
connect to real world IO or to the HMI.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Configuration:</h2> 

<p>Configuration is performed through a configuration file called 
<strong>"mblogic.config"</strong>. This file holds all the data table names, 
addresses, and other required information. This is a plain text file which can 
be edited with any text editor. The configuration file is defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>One line per parameter. Each parameter must appear on a separate line.</li>
	<li>Comments. Any line beginning with a "hash" ("#") character is a comment
	and is ignored.</li>
	<li>Sections. Sections begin a series of related configuration values. A section
	name is an identifier which is enclosed by square brackets ("[ ]"). A section 
	includes all items until the beginning of a new section, or until the end of 
	the file. </li>
	<li>Configuration items. Any line following the beginning of a section is considered
	to be an item which belongs to that section (excluding comments). Configuration
	items are key/value pairs in the format "key=value". </li>
</ul> 


<hr>

<h2>System Identification:</h2> 

<p>The configuration must include a section named "&amp;system". The system 
identification section is used to define parameters which apply to the
overall soft logic system. These factors are: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>type - This defines which soft logic library will be used to interpret
	the soft logic program. Only the "ck" library exists at present. Others
	may be added in future. </li>
	<li>plcprog - This determines the name used for the softlogic program file.
	Set this to the name you wish to use for your program file. </li>
	<li>scan - This is the <em>target</em> scan rate in milli-seconds. The 
	system will attempt to run your soft logic program once every 'x' 
	milli-seconds, where 'x' is the value you provide. See the comments on
	application considerations below with regards to how to set this value. </li>
</ul>



<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="examples">

	[&amp;system]
	type=ck
	plcprog=plcprog.txt
	scan=50

</pre>



<hr>

<h2>Data Table Save/Restore:</h2> 

<p>The configuration must include a section named "&amp;logicsave". This section 
is used to define parameters which apply to the data table save and restore 
system (see the help topic on "Soft Logic Data Table Save" for details on
how this works). These factors are: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>updateinterval - This defines the minimum update interval. This must
	be a valid integer or floating point number.	</li>
	<li>wordaddr - This is a list of soft logic word addresses which are to
	be saved to disk. These may be any valid word (not boolean) addresses. 
	Individual addresses must be separated by commas. </li>
</ul>



<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="examples">

	[&amp;logicsave]
	updateinterval=2.0
	wordaddr=DS1,DS2,DS3,DS4,DS5,DS6,DS7,DS8,DS9,DS10

</pre>


<hr>


<h2>IO Sections:</h2> 

<p>The remainder of the configuration consists of "IO sections". An IO section 
defines a group of addresses which are two be transferred between the two data 
tables. The section names are arbitrary, and the user is free to select any 
name desired provided it does not start with an ampersand ("&amp;"). Names starting 
with an ampersand (e.g. "&amp;system") are considered special and reserved for use
by the soft logic system.   
</p>


<h3>Address Types:</h3>
<p>Address types determine how data is stored in the system data table. This 
includes the number of storage locations (e.g. registers) and the byte ordering.
For numeric address types which occupy multiple registers, the least significant
word is stored in the platform's native format. For Intel type CPUs (big endian), 
the first (lower address) register. For string data types, characters are stored
in consecutively increasing addresses.  
The following address types are currently defined:
</p>

<h3>Configuring IO Sections:</h3> 

<p>An IO section must contain the following items:  
</p>

<ul>
	<li>addrtype - This defines the type of system data table address. It must
	be one of the address types listed above. </li>
	<li>base - This is the beginning of the block of system data table addresses
	defined. The number of addresses used will depend on the number of soft logic
	addresses defined in the "logictable" parameter.</li>
	<li>action - This must be either "read" or "write". Specifying "read" will
	cause the IO section to transfer data <em>from</em> the system data
	table <em>to</em> the soft logic table. Specifying "write" will
	cause the IO section to transfer data <em>to</em> the system data
	table <em>from</em> the soft logic table. </li>
	<li>logictable - This must be one or more valid soft logic addresses,
	with multiple addresses separated by commas (e.g. "X1,Y10,C9". This
	defines the soft logic data table addresses that data will be transferred
	to or from. Addresses do not need to be in any particular order, but
	the must all be of a compatible type. Native data types may define multiple
	addresses. Extended data types are limited to a single address. </li>
	<li>strlen - This parameter is only used with string length. It defines
	the maximum number of characters for the string. This parameter is ignored
	for other data types.</li>
</ul>


<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="examples">

	[PBs]
	addrtype=coil
	base=32100
	action=read
	logictable=X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6,X7,X8

</pre>


<pre class="examples">

	[PartCount]
	addrtype=holdingreg32
	base=42
	action=write
	logictable=DS101

</pre>


<pre class="examples">

	[PartName]
	addrtype=inputregstr16
	base=1234
	action=read
	logictable=TXT99
	strlen=10

</pre>


<p><em><strong>Review the documentation on the system data table before 
deciding which registers, coils, or discrete inputs to use.

<h2>Application Considerations:</h2>

<h3>Grouping IO Addresses:</h3>

<p>A configuration must include one (and only one) "system identification" 
("&amp;system") section. It may include as many "IO" sections as desired. The IO 
sections may be given meaningful names (e.g. "PushButtons"). However, the
primary purpose of a section is to group associated addresses together so they 
can be dealt with efficiently. A good approach is to have each IO section 
represent an field device module or IO card(s). This of course assumes that the 
client and server commands for the system data table have been grouped
in this manner.    
</p>

<p>Addresses in the system data table are handled most efficiently when they 
are read or written in consecutive blocks.
</p>

<p>For the soft logic data table, it does not matter what order addresses are
in, or whether they are grouped together. This means that if you wish to group
or organise addresses in your program differently in your soft logic program 
than they are organised in the actual field devices, it is best to do this
in the soft logic configuration and to leave the actual IO communications in
their natural order.
</p>

<h3>Soft Logic Program Name:</h3>

<p>The name used for the soft logic program is defined in the system parameters
(see above). Any name can be used, provided it doesn't conflict with the 
name of a file which is part of the system (e.g. one of the configuration files). 
The file can also have any file extension desired or even no file extension. 
This allows names such as "Machine_021.prog" or "Water_System.txt" (or whatever 
else is desired). 
</p>

<h3>Program Scan Rate:</h3>

<p>The soft logic program target scan rate is defined in the system parameters 
(see above). The target scan rate means that the system will attempt to run 
one scan of the soft logic program at the requested interval. Note that this 
is the <em>desired</em> scan rate, not the measured rate.  
</p>

<p>A soft logic system differs from a conventional PLC in that the soft logic 
system is running on a general purpose computer platform. There may be other 
things such as HMIs, databases, and other tasks running on the same platform.
On a conventional PLC, to add more features you would normally just add more 
hardware modules (with each feature needing its own hardware to run on). A 
soft logic system will often have to share the hardware with other applications.    
This means that the soft logic system cannot assume that all the computing 
resources are available for its exclusive use.
</p>

<p>For a soft logic system, this means that taking up 100% of the CPU capacity 
to scan the program as fast as possible is not a good idea. In a new application,  
the target scan rate should be initially set to a larger value (e.g. 50 msec) 
and then adjusted downwards to smaller values as needed. The amount of CPU
capacity being used can be measured by using the normal operating system 
utilities for whatever operating system you are using (e.g. "top" or "System 
Monitor" for Linux, or the equivalent utility for MS Windows).    
</p>

<p>The program scan rate is set at system start up and cannot be changed 
while the system is running. This means that to change the scan rate, you 
need to stop and restart the system.  
</p>

<h3>Changing the Configuration:</h3>

<p>The soft logic IO configuration is specified in a configuration file.
This file is read when the system starts up. However, the configuration 
can also be changed while the system is running by reloading the configuration 
using the system "status" interface. Details of how to do this may be found 
in the help pages which are part of the status system.
