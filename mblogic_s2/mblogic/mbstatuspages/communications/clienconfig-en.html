<h1>Help - Client Communications Configuration</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>Clients configurations are saved in a text file called 
<strong><em>"mbclient.config"</em></strong>. This configuration 
file is read on start up of the software and used to determine what protocols to 
enable, what network addresses and ports to use, what data to read or write, etc. 
This file must be edited in order to configure a system for every individual 
application. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Configuration Overview</h2>

<h3>Editing a Configuration</h3>

<p>There is one, and only one client communications configuration file for 
each system. This file is in ASCII text format and may be edited with any 
standard text editor. If you use a word processor, be sure to save in a plain 
text mode which does not insert formatting characters into the text. 
</p>


<h3>Configuration Elements</h3>

<p>A client communications configuration file contains the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Client connections - This configures the client names, protocol type, 
	address, polling rate, and other information.</li>
	<li>Client commands - This configures the client communications commands, 
	including memory addresses, protocol functions, and other information.</li>
	<li>Fault Configuration - This configures the client communications fault 
	indication, including the memory addresses where the fault information is 
	stored.</li>
	<li>Comments - Comments may be included in the configuration file to assist 
	in documenting the particular application configuration.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Configuration Syntax</h3>

<p>The configuration syntax has the following general properties:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sections. Sections begin a series of related configuration values. 
	A section name is an identifier which is enclosed by square brackets 
	("[ ]"). A section includes all items until the beginning of a new section, 
	or until the end of the file. Section names must be unique and must not
	be duplicated in any other section. Duplicate section names are ignored. </li>
	<li>Configuration items. Any line following the beginning of a section is considered 
	to be an item which belongs to that section (excluding comments). Configuration 
	items are key/value pairs in the format "key=value". </li>
	<li>Each item must be on a separate line.</li>
	<li>Keys are separated from values by equal signs ("="). Because equal signs are 
	used as key/value separators, they may not be used as part of any key or value.</li>
	<li>Parameters are case sensitive. All keys and values must be in the correct 
	case. For example, "Main1", "main1", and "mAin1" are three different identifiers.</li>
	<li>All keys or values which are defined by the configuration syntax are 
	always in lower case. </li>
	<li>User defined values may be in upper, lower, or mixed case.</li>
	<li>The ampersand ("&amp;") character has special meaning. Certain sections are
	predefined by the configuration system. The names for these will start with 
	an ampersand. User defined section names may not start with an ampersand.
	Command item names must start with an ampersand. Any item starting with
	an ampersand is assumed to be a command. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Any line beginning with a '#' character is considered to be a comment and is 
ignored. Comments must begin at the start of a line, and may not be on the same 
line as any other valid input. 
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre class="examples">

	# 16-Apr-2008. This is a comment.
	# This is also a comment.

</pre>


<hr>


<h2>TCP Client Connections</h2>

<p>TCP Client connections define the connection parameters to an external server 
(e.g. an I/O module, valve bank, or RTU). Each client connection executes 
independently of (is not synchronised with) any other client connect. 
</p>

<h2>Generic Clients</h2>

<p>Generic clients permit adding new clients to the system without making them
a permanent part of the software. This is accomplished by running the generic
client as a separate process (program) and having it commmunicate with the main
system via a special protocol. Generic clients are primarily intended to make
integrating serial protocols (including custom protocols) into the main system
easier. but they are not restricted to serial communications, nor indeed are they
restricted to communications at all.  
</p>

<p><em><strong>Generic client support is still experimental and subject to change in
future.</strong></em>  
</p>

<h3>Client File Name</h3>

<p>The file name of the generic client is specified by the "clientfile" 
parameter. This <em><strong>must</strong></em> be a valid Python program file.
The system will explicitly call the Python interpreter to execute the file.  
</p>

<p>The file name parameter can include additional command line parameters.
These parameters will be passed to the client at start up. 
</p>

<p>However, the system has parameters of its own which it passes to the client,
and any user defined parameters must not interfere with these. These system
parameters are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>c - Client name. This is the name of the client (as defined in the 
		section name).</li>
	<li>p - The generic interface server port number.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Restart Characteristics</h3>

<p>If a generic client unexpectedly exits ("dies") while running, it can be
automatically restarted by setting the appropriate option for "restartonfail". 
The restart options are as follows: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>yes - Restart the client if it terminates unexpectedly.</li>
	<li>no - <em>Do not</em> restart the client if it terminates unexpectedly.</li>
	<li>nostart - Do not start the client at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system monitors configured clients to see if they are running. This
check takes place at approximately 1 second intervals. If "restartonfail" is 
set to "yes", and if the client terminates unexpectedly, the system will 
attempt to restart it immediately at the next check interval. The system
will attempt to restart the client up to 5 times. If the maximum number of 
restart attempts is exceeded, the system will cease trying to restart that
client. If the client was successfully restarted, the restart counter is reset. 
This means a client can be automatically restarted as many times as necessary,
provided the number of <em>consecutive</em> unsuccessful attempts is not exceeded.
</p>

<h3>Data Table Read and Write Addresses</h3>

<p>A generic client communicates with the main server by copying a selected 
part of the data table to and from the server. The "readtable" item specifies 
the addresses to be read from the server and copied to the generic client. The 
"writetable" item specifies the addresses to be read from the generic client 
and copied to the main server. They are specified in the format:  
"&lt;type&gt;=&lt;address&gt;:&lt;length&gt;". 
The address types may be the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>coil - Coil addresses.</li>
	<li>inp - Discrete input addresses.</li>
	<li>holdingreg - Holding register addresses.</li>
	<li>inpreg - Input register addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The addresses may be any valid address for each type. The lengths may be any
length which does not result in attempting to read or write beyond the end of
the data table. These parameters are not limited by Modbus protocol read or 
write specifications. Any type may be read from or written to. Any quantity may
be transferred at once. However, excessively large data transfers may cause
problems with system performance.  
</p>

<p>In addition to the above types, the type of "none" is also valid. This may
be used as a placeholder to specify that no data transfer is requested for 
that item. Some examples are:
</p> 

<pre class="examples">

	# Do not read any addresses
	readtable= none
	# Write 10 coils starting at 9100, and 4 holding registers starting at 9650
	writetable= coil=9100:10, holdingreg=9650:4

	# Read and write all types.
	readtable= coil=9100:10, inp=9100:11, holdingreg=9650:4, inpreg=10000:1
	writetable= coil=900:10, inp=900:1, holdingreg=62050:150, inpreg=2:99

</pre>


<h3>Client Configuration Items</h3>

<p>Any parameters which are not recognised by the server as standard generic
client items, and which are not commands are passed to the generic client as
is. This allows a generic client to define their own parameters as required
for the application. 
</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>Client commands are the actions to be executed for each client connection. 
Commands within a connection are executed consecutively. Commands for generic
clients are defined by the application and need not be present. The server
however will parse them from the parameter set for convenience. The generic
client is responsible for validating the command parameters.   
</p>


<h3>Example</h3>


<pre class="examples">

	# This is used to help demonstrate the generic client.
	[CasClient]
	type=genericclient

<h2>Fault Configuration</h2>

<p>Fault configurations are the memory addresses where communications faults
which are detected by each client are indicated. There must be only one
fault configuration per client. 
</p>

<h3>Configuration Items</h3>

<table class="helptable"  border="1">
<tr>
	<th>Item</th> 
	<th>Description</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>fault_inp</td>
	<td>When a fault is detected, this discrete input will be turned 
		on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>fault_coil</td>
	<td>When a fault is detected, this coil will be turned on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>fault_inpreg</td>
	<td>When a fault is detected, this input register will be 
	set to a non-zero value. The value will be protocol dependent and may indicate 
	the type of fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>fault_holdingreg</td>
	<td>When a fault is detected, this input register will be 
	set to a non-zero value. The value will be protocol dependent and may indicate 
	the type of fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>fault_reset</td>
	<td>When this coil address is turned on, the fault indication 
	bits and	registers are reset to "0", and this coil is turned off. Only the 
	highest (last) 256 coils may be used as fault reset coils. If a lower address 
	is selected no error will be indicated, but the coil will not be monitored to 
	reset the fault indicating registers or bits.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3>Example</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	fault_inp=256 
	fault_coil=97 
	fault_inpreg=10000 
	fault_holdingreg=52000 
	fault_reset=65281

</pre>

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

<p>The items may appear in any order. </p>

<p>Fault configurations are part of the section they are associated with
and must be defined as part of that section. All of the fault configuration 
items must appear with each client. 
</p>

<p>The fault reset coils are scanned once every several seconds. It therefore may
take several (e.g. 2 or 3) seconds for the faults to reset once the reset coil
is activated. 
</p>

<p>All four indicating parameters (inp, coil, inpreg, holdingreg) are equivalent
in that all are turned on together in the event of any fault. This means that
any one of these may be read to determine the presence of a fault. It is 
suggested that addresses be chosen to allow them to be read as part of the
same read operation as other normal data. 
</p>

<h2>Loop Back Sample</h2>

<p>The sample configuration file supplied with the system uses what is referred to 
as a "loop-back" configuration for the clients. That is, a set of Modbus/TCP 
clients are configured to poll the system's own Modbus/TCP server. This is not in 
itself a useful feature. It is provided mainly to demonstrate the communications 
features. A different configuration should be created for a practical application. 
The sample configuration demonstrates the following features. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Several Modbus/TCP clients are started, each demonstrating a different
	configuration. These clients read and write the data table through the 
	Modbus/TCP server (noted above).</li>
</ul>
