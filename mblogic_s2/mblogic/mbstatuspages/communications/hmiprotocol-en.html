<h1>Help - HMI Protocol</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>The HMI protocol is intended to support a web based HMI system. It supports: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tag based data table access.</li>
	<li>Automatic data conversion and scaling.</li>
	<li>Events.</li>
	<li>Alarms.</li>
</ul>


<p>The HMI protocol is based on JSON. While it is primarily intended for HMI 
systems, it can also be used as a general purpose web service for other 
applications such as enterprise integration. 
</p>

<p>The protocol itself is not described in detail here. Please consult the help
pages for the HMI system for more details. The following provides a brief 
overview.
</p>

<p>The HMI system uses a protocol called "Cascadas" which was developed for 
the purpose.  
</p>


<hr>

<h2>HMI Servers and Services</h2>

<p>The HMI protocol can be configured to provide multiple services. These are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>HMI (Standard)</strong> - This is the standard HMI service and
		includes an integrated web server for loading HMI web pages. It allows
		read/write access via the HMI protocol.</li>
	<li><strong>Restricted HMI</strong> - This provides access to the same HMI
		protocol as the standard version, except that access is read-only. This
		can be used to provide HMI access to users without providing them the
		ability to write to the system data table or acknowledge alarms. </li>
	<li><strong>RSS Monitoring</strong> - This provides an RSS feed of selected
		HMI events. This is available on both the standard and restricted HMI 
		ports. </li>
	<li><strong>ERP Protocol</strong> - This is a limited version of the HMI
		protocol intended to allow access for ERP/MRP applications. The ERP
		version however limits the features available, and allows tag access to 
		be limited. </li>
	<li><strong>Alarm and Event Database Access</strong> - The alarm and event
		database can be queried via a web service API. This does not use the HMI
		protocol, but is accessed via the HMI servers (both normal and restricted
		versions). </li>
</ul>

<p>The normal and restricted HMI servers will use different IP ports. Any 
available port may be used for either. Both the normal and restricted HMI
servers use the same HMI configuration. 
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Address Tags</h2>

<p>Address tags are aliases for addresses in the system data table. They can
be used when reading from or writing to individual addresses (or series of 
addresses) when using the HMI protocol. For example, the tag name "PB1" may
be used to represent the system data table coil address 100.  
</p>

<h3>Type Conversions</h3>

<p>Different data types may be associated with a tag, including integers, 
floating point numbers and strings. Details of these may be found in the 
section on "HMI Configuration". However, it is suffice to say here that the 
HMI configuration system can be used to automatically convert between different
data types. For example, numbers can be converted between integers and floating
point, depending on what is required for the application.
</p>

<h3>Scaling</h3>

<p>Numerical values can be automatically scaled to convert between raw analogue 
values and engineering units. For example, a 12 bit analogue number (0 to 4095)  
representing an LVDT reading could be scaled to read the equivalent value in 
millimeters. The same applies when converting values input from an HMI screen 
and being written back to the system data table. This scaling can be specified
in the configuration and requires no special logic to be written to support it.
</p>

<h3>Reserved Tags</h3>

<p>The protocol has several pre-defined "reserved" tags. These are: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>timeutc</strong> - This is the current time as UTC. This is a 
		floating point number representing a POSIX time stamp.</li>
	<li><strong>timelocal</strong> - This is the current time as local time
		on the server. This is also a POSIX time stamp.</li>
	<li><strong>clientversion</strong> - This is a string representing the 
		current version of the <em>client</em>. </li>
	<li><strong>protocolversion</strong> - This is a string representing the 
		version of the HMI protocol supported by the server.</li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h2>Alarms</h2>

<p>Alarms are messages which are brought to the attention of the operator and
which the operator must acknowledge. Each alarm is associated with an "alarm
tag". Each alarm tag is in turn associated with a coil address in the system
data table. The HMI protocol provides alarm messages with the following 
features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Alarm Tag</strong> - The alarm message passes the alarm tag to
		the HMI client (e.g. web page), not the actual alarm message. Associating
		the alarm tag with an actual text message is the responsibility of the 
		HMI client. This means it is possible for the same HMI message to support
		multiple languages (e.g. both English and French) simultaneously.  
		</li>
	<li><strong>Time</strong> - The time at which the alarm condition was 
		detected is included in the message. This time is sent as UTC (GMT) so
		the system can operate independently of time zones.
		</li>
	<li><strong>Time OK</strong> - The time at which the alarm condition became
		"OK" (the cause is no longer present) is also part of the message.
		</li>
	<li><strong>State</strong> - The state of the alarm is also included (see
		below for an explanation of alarm states).
		</li>
	<li><strong>Count</strong> - The number of times that an alarm occured 
		before "going away" is included. This means that if an alarm condition 
		occurs multiple times before being corrected, the number of times this
		happens can be displayed to the operator. This allows alarms to be
		summarised in a compact and easy to understand form. 
		</li>
</ul>

<h3>Acknowledging Alarms</h3>

<p>Alarms must be <em>acknowledged</em> by the operator. Acknowledging an 
alarms means sending a message that the operator has been made aware of the
alarm. This is accomplished by sending a message from the HMI client to the
HMI server. 
</p>


<h3>Alarm States</h3>

<p>Alarms can be in the following states:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>alarm</strong> - The alarm condition is true, and the alarm has 
		not been acknowledged.</li>
	<li><strong>ackalarm</strong> - The alarm condition is true, and the alarm 
		has been acknowledged.</li>
	<li><strong>ok</strong> - The alarm condition is false, but the alarm has 
		not been acknowledged yet.</li>
	<li><strong>ackok</strong> - The alarm condition is false, and the alarm 
		has been acknowledged.</li>
	<li><strong>inactive</strong> - The alarm condition is false, and the alarm 
		has been acknowledged.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Alarm History</h3>

<p>Once an alarm message has been acknowledged and the condition causing the
alarm is no longer present, the alarm message itself goes into the "alarm 
history". The alarm history is available for viewing by the operator. The alarm
history also includes which operator station acknowledged the alarm.  
</p>


<h3>Triggering Alarm</h3>

<p>Once an alarm has been defined in the HMI configuration it can be triggered 
by turning on the associated coil address in the system data table. The alarm 
address may be turned on by any source able to write to the system data table.
</p>

<p>An alarm is present when the alarm adress is <em>on</em> (or "1", or 
"true"). 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Events are similar to alarms in that they represent occurances which are
brought to the attention of the operator. Unlike alarms, events do not require
the operator to acknowledge them. While alarms normally represent problems 
which require the operator to take corrective actions, events are usually 
simply status information which the operator can review. Like alarms, events
are associated with coil addresses in the system data table. Event messages 
include the following:  
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Event Tag</strong> - Like alarm messages, event messages include
		an "event tag" representing the event, but not the actual event message 
		text. Again, the reason for this is to allow the HMI system to support
		multiple languages simultaneously. </li>
	<li><strong>Time</strong> - This is the time at which the event occured (in 
		UTC).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Triggering Events</h3>

<p>Once an event has been defined in the HMI configuration it can be triggered 
by turning on the associated coil address in the system data table. The event 
address may be turned on by any source able to write to the system data table.
</p>

<p>Events are "edge triggered". That is, they are triggered when the event
address changes from <em>off</em> to <em>on</em> (or "0" to "1", or "false" 
to "true"). 
</p>

<p>On start up, the system initialses the event system with the current state
of the event addresses. That means that events addresses which are initially 
"on" will not trigger an event until the event address turns "off" and then 
"on" again.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Alarm and Event Zones</h2>

<p>Alarms, alarm history, and events are grouped into user defined "zones". 
These zones allow an individual HMI client to ask for and receive only those
alarms or events of interest to it. Typical small to medium size HMI systems
would normally simply group all alarms and events into a single set of zones 
(zone definitions for alarms and events are independent of each other). Larger
HMI applications however may wish to use several different zones to represent
different areas of a machine, production line, or plant.   
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Alarm and Event Serial Numbers</h2>

<p>The system uses message serial numbers to track messages. The actual values
used for these serial numbers is not significant and should not be relied on
for any other purposes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Supporting Multiple HMI Systems</h2>

<p>The HMI protocol is designed to inherently support multiple HMI displays 
without requring any explicit coordination between them. This includes data, 
alarms, events, and alarm acknowledge messages. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Logging Alarm History and Events</h2>

<p>Alarm history and events are automatically logged to a database. On start 
up, the system will retrieve the most recent set of alarm history and event
messages from the database and make them available for an HMI client.   
</p>

<p>Current alarms are <em>not</em> logged in the database as they represent
a dynamically changing condition. Once the alarm has become part of the
alarm history however (the alarm condition is no longer present, and the
operator has acknowledged it), it is automatically logged as part of the 
alarm history.
</p>

<p>The contents of the database can be retrieved by other programs via a web 
service protocol. This protocol is documented as one of the sytem services.
</p>
