<h1>Help - Generic Clients</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>"Generic clients" are external add-on modules which can be used to implement
additional functionality. The main purpose for having generic clients is to 
make it easier to write serial (RS-232) client interfaces. However, generic
clients can also be used for Ethernet communications, file or database access, 
or any other application where it is desired to add custom functionality.  
</p>

<p><em><strong>Generic clients are experimental at this stage, and the 
interface is subject to change. If you intend to make use of this feature
at this stage in its development, be prepared to make minor modifications to 
your custom generic clients in future versions. </strong></em>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Generic Client Server Interface</h2>

<p>Generic clients associate with the main system by communicating with it
via the "generic client" server interface. This uses a remote procedure call
mechanism called "Perspective Broker" which is part of the Twisted 
communications framework.
</p>

<p>A generic client runs as a seperate program that communicates with the main
system through the generic server interface. The generic server interface must 
be configured and running before any generic clients may work with the main 
system.
</p>

<h3>Generic Client Names</h3>

<p>Each <em>instance</em> of a generic client must be given a unique name. That 
means that even when running two or more copies of the same type of client, each
copy must have its own name. The <em>name</em> of the client does not necessarily
mean the name of the file containing the client. Two or more clients may use the
same code from the same file, but be given different names. The name is simply
a parameter passed to the client which it uses to identify itself to the server
when it starts up. 
</p>

<p>For example, the system may need to interface with two identical weigh scales.
The same client program file can be used for both, but they must be given 
different names when they are started so the correct parameters can be passed
to them.
</p>

<h3>Generic Client Parameters</h3>

<p>The parameters for each generic client instance are defined in the 
client communications configuration file ("mbclient.config") just like all 
other client configurations. These parameters follow a similar format
to those used with TCP clients. In addition, each client can have custom 
parameters which are not "understood" by the server, but are simply passed
on to the client for its own use. This allows the standard configuration system
to load and parse the parameters while allowing each type of client to have
whatever parameters are appropriate to the application.
</p>

<p>Details of the configuration parameters can be found in the section on 
communications configuration.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Generic Client Start and Stop Sequence</h2>


<ol>
	<li>When the system starts up, it reads and parses the communications 
		configuration file</li>
	<li>If any generic clients are found, it attempts to start them. </li>
	<li>Each generic client contacts the generic client interface server and
		requests its parameter set by name.</li>
	<li>The generic server interface server sends the parameter set to the 
		client.</li>
	<li>The client validates its parameters, and sends any error messages back
		to the server.</li>
	<li>The generic client runs on a regular scan cycle, performing its own 
		tasks and exchanging data and status information with the server.</li>
	<li>When the main system wishes to shut down, it sends a "stop" command to
		each generic client, requesting that they stop executing and exit.</li>
	<li>The system then waits for a fixed time. When this time delay has passed,
		the system will forcibly terminate any generic clients which may still
		be running.</li>
	<li>The system then completes its own shutdown and exits.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>File Locations</h2>

<p>Generic clients are located in a directory called "genclient". The system
will automatically look in that directory for any specified files. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Protocols and Message Transports</h2>

<p>Generic clients are primarily intended to allow the addition of protocols
and custom interfaces. These typically include serial protocols, but can also
include protocols that use HTTP and low level socket access. Since the generic
client runs independently from the main system, it will not block or interrupt
the operation of the main system. However, the client should not block (stop)
execution of the main client loop for long periods of time as the main system
may interpret that behaviour as indicating the client has faulted ("locked-up").
</p>

<p>Some available libraries for implementing client protcols are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>socket - This is a standard Python library that offers direct TCP, UDP,
		and unix socket access.</li>
	<li>urllib2 - This is a standard Python library that offers simple HTTP
		protocol access.</li>
	<li>pyserial - This is a third party library that offers access to the
		serial port.</li>
</ul>
