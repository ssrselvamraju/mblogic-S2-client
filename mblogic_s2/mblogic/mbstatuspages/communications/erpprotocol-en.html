<h1>Help - ERP Protocol</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>The ERP protocol is a subset of the HMI protocol which is intended to allow
access for ERP/MRP (Enterprise/Manufacturing Resource Planning) applications. 
This protocol uses the same configuration as the conventional HMI protocol, but
limits the available features, and also allows the number of tags and the type
of access (read or write).
</p>

<p>Like the HMI server, the ERP server can automatically convert types, perform
scaling, and enforce data ranges. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Web Service Protocols</h2>

<p>The ERP protocol is a type of "web service protocol". A web service protocol
operates over HTTP like a web page, but transfers machine readable data rather 
than a simple web page. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Basic Message Format</h2>

<p>The ERP Protocol uses a subset of the HMI protocol using JSON over HTTP.
JSON is a standard encoding of data for web services based on "keys" and 
"values".
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	{"key1":123, "somekey":"value", "arrayexample":[1, 2, 3]}

</pre>

<h3>Basic Message Request Format</h3>

<p>The basic message format consists of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>id</strong> - This is a client ID string which is used to 
		identify the client. The contents can be any string.</li>
	<li><strong>msgid</strong> - This is a sequential integer which is used by
		the client to track requests and responses. The server will echo this
		number back.</li>
</ul>


<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id":"ERP Client 123.",
	"msgid":456,
	}

</pre>

<h3>Basic Message Response Format</h3>

<p>The basic response format contains the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>id</strong> - This is the server ID string which as defined in
		the HMI configuration.</li>
	<li><strong>msgid</strong> - This is an echo of the msgid value sent by the
		client.</li>
	<li><strong>stat</strong> - This is a string representing a status or error
		code.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id": "HMIServer demo server",
	"msgid": 456,
	"stat": "ok",
	}

</pre>

<h3>Status Codes</h3>


<ul>
	<li><strong>unauthorized</strong> - The client is not authorized to 
		communicate with the server.</li>
	<li><strong>protocolerror</strong> - An error was encountered in the 
		protocol and it could not be accepted. The entire message was discarded 
		by the server.</li>
	<li><strong>commanderror</strong> - A request command field provided 
		incorrect or invalid data. Check each possible error response for any 
		errors. Multiple errors are possible. </li>
	<li><strong>servererror</strong> - An unspecified error has occurred in the 
		server which prevents the request from being completed. The error is not 
		specified in any of the return fields. </li>
	<li><strong>ok</strong> - No errors.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Read Command</h2>

<p>The <em>read</em> command specifies which address tags should be read. It
consists of a list of the address tag names which the client wishes to read.
This command is optional and can be left out if it is not needed.
</p>

<h3>Request</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id":"ERP Client 123.",
	"msgid":456,
	"read" : ["Tank1Level", "WidgetCount"],
	}

</pre>

<h3>Response</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id": "HMIServer demo server",
	"msgid": 0,
	"stat": "ok",
	"timestamp": 1238156675.0,
	"read": {"Tank1Level": 9875, "WidgetCount" : 87},
	}

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>Write Command</h2>

<p>The <em>write</em> command is a group of address tags and values which are 
to be written to the server.
</p>

<h3>Request</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id":"ERP Client 123.",
	"msgid":456,
	"write" : {"Pump1Speed" : 2250},
	}

</pre>

<h3>Response</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id":"ERP Client 123.",
	"msgid":456,
	}

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>Combined Read/Write</h2>

<p>Reads and writes can be combined in a single transaction.
</p>


<h3>Request</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id":"ERP Client 123.",
	"msgid":456,
	"read" : ["Tank1Level", "WidgetCount"],
	"write" : {"Pump1Speed" : 2250},
	}

</pre>

<h3>Response</h3>

<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id": "HMIServer demo server",
	"msgid": 0,
	"stat": "ok",
	"timestamp": 1238156675.0,
	"read": {"Tank1Level": 9875, "WidgetCount" : 87},
	}

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>Read and Write Errors</h2>

<p>Read and write errors are reported in the "readerr" and "writeerr" fields
in the response. The "readerr" and "writeerr" fields are only present in the
response if there is a corresponding error to report.
</p>


<pre class="examples">

	{
	"id": "HMIServer demo server",
	"msgid": 9875,
	"stat": "commanderror",
	"timestamp": 1238156675.0,
	"writeerr": {"PBBad": "tagnotfound"}
	}

</pre>

<h3>Error codes:</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>accessdenied</strong> - The client does not have authorization 
		to access this tag.</li>
	<li><strong>tagnotfound</strong> - The address tag is not recognized by the 
		server.</li>
	<li><strong>writeprotected</strong> - An attempt was made to write to an 
		address which is write protected or otherwise not writable.</li>
	<li><strong>badtype</strong> - The data value is of an incompatible type 
		and cannot be converted to the desired type.</li>
	<li><strong>outofrange</strong> - The data value is out of range. Range 
		limits may be imposed by the server based on data type or through 
		configuration limits imposed on a per-tag basis.</li>
	<li><strong>addresserror</strong> - An error occurred in attempting to map 
		the tag to the internal server address representation.</li>
	<li><strong>servererror</strong> - An unspecified error has occurred in the 
		server which prevents the request from being completed.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The ERP server uses the same tag configuration as the HMI server. However,
the ERP server has the following limits on it:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>It on supports the "read" and "write" commands. None of the other 
		commands (e.g. alarms, events, etc.) are supported.</li>
	<li>Only those tags which are specified as being available to the ERP server
		can be accessed by it.</li>
	<li>The tags which are configured as being available to the ERP server can
		be designated as read or write (or both). Tags which are designated as 
		"read" but are not designated as "write" cannot be written to. </li> 
	<li>Conversely, tags which are not designated as "read" cannot be read even
		if they can be written to (marked "write"). A tag is read-write if the
		ERP configuration lists it as both "read" and "write".    
		</li>
	<li>If the underlying memory type is not writable, list a tag as "write"
		for ERP purposes will not make the tag writable, and you will still
		receive an error when you attempt to write to it.  
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Configuration syntax can be found in the section on HMI configuration, and
also in the section on using the status web interface for form based 
configuration.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Creating an ERP Client Interface</h2>

<p>To create a custom client interface to the ERP server, you need the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A JSON library. These are available for almost all languages and are
		standard in many.</li>
	<li>The ability to make an HTTP POST request to a URL. This is also a very
		common feature for modern programming languages</li>
</ul>

<p>You then need to do the following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Find which server "tags", and make any additions or changes to them 
		which are necessary. This is part of the server HMI configuration.</li>
	<li>Add the tags to the ERP configuration in the server HMI configuration
		file. To make the changes active, you may need to reload the server
		configuration (this can be done while the system is running).</li>
	<li>Construct the request message and encode it as JSON. You can combine 
		<em>read</em> and <em>write</em> commands in the same message.</li>
	<li>Make an HTTP POST request to the server, using the appropriate URL.
		The server port is configurable. The JSON message should be attached 
		to the request as content.</li>
	<li>The server will respond with the data attached as content. </li>
	<li>Decode the response JSON. </li>
	<li>Check to see if the response "stat" is "ok". If it is not, an error
		is present. </li>
	<li>You may check the "msgid" to see if it matches the version sent in the
		request.</li>
	<li>If an error ws present ("stat" was not "ok"), check the "readerr" and 
		"writeerr" fields for the reason. Errors are normally caused by 
		attempting to use a tag which does not exist or which is write 
		protected, or by attempting to write a value which is of an incompatible 
		type or out of range. The server can be configured to enforce data 
		ranges on a per-tag basis.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example Client</h2>

<p>The following is an example ERP client written in Python.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	#!/usr/bin/python
	# This shows a basic demo for an ERP client.
	# This will work with the standard HMI demo.
	# 29-Dec-2010.

	import json
	import urllib2

	# This is the data we are going to send to the server.
	# We need a client id, and a message id. In addition, if we want to 
	# read data, we need to include a list of the tags we want to read. If we want to
	# write data, we need to include a dictionary with the tags and values that we
	# want to write.
	basicdemo = {
	  'id' : 'ErpDemo',
	  'msgid' : 0,
	  'read' : ['PL1', 'PL4', 'PumpSpeedActual', 'PumpSpeedCmd', 'Tank1Level', 
	  			'Tank2Number', 'hello', 'ButtonDisPB'],
	  'write' : {'PB1' : 1, 'PumpSpeedCmd' : -2, 'writebad' : 777, 'SSPPGrip' : 1}
	}

	# Encode the dictionary into JSON format using the standard Python library.
	JsonOut = json.dumps(basicdemo)

	# Send the data using POST. 
	req = urllib2.Request(url = 'http://localhost:8084/', data = JsonOut)
	f = urllib2.urlopen(req)

	# Read the response.
	JsonIn = f.read()

	# Convert from JSON into a dictionary. 
	respdata = json.loads(JsonIn)

	# We will iterate through the 'read' response and show the values that we read.
	# The dictionary will also contain other data (such as errors) which are not 
	# showing here. 
	print('Read response was')
	readdata = respdata.get('read', {})
	for tag, value in readdata.items():
		print('\tTag: %s  Value: %s' % (tag, value))

	# Read errors.
	readerr = respdata.get('readerr', {})
	if readerr:
		print('\nRead errors')
		for tag, value in readerr.items():
			print('\tTag: %s  Value: %s' % (tag, value))

	# Write errors.
	writeerr = respdata.get('writeerr', {})
	if writeerr:
		print('\nWrite errors')
		for tag, value in writeerr.items():
			print('\tTag: %s  Value: %s' % (tag, value))


</pre>

<p>The output from the above is (when used with the standard HMI
demo configuration):
</p>


<pre class="examples">

	Read response was
		Tag: PumpSpeedActual  Value: 5
		Tag: PL4  Value: 0
		Tag: PumpSpeedCmd  Value: -2
		Tag: PL1  Value: 1
		Tag: Tank2Number  Value: 75.0
		Tag: Tank1Level  Value: 70

	Read errors
		Tag: ButtonDisPB  Value: accessdenied
		Tag: hello  Value: tagnotfound

	Write errors
		Tag: SSPPGrip  Value: accessdenied
		Tag: writebad  Value: tagnotfound
