<h1>Help - Installation - Using Port 502:</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>Standard Ethernet protocols use what are called "ports". These are numbers
which are part of the Ethernet packets which are used to route them to the
correct application program. Both ends of the connection (client and server)
have to use an agreed upon port number in order to communicate with each other. 
The server must "bind to the port number" (request the number from the operating 
system) before it can listen on that port for requests. Clients on the other 
hand do not have to bind to a port and are free to send requests to any port. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Standard Modbus Port:</h2>

<p>The standard port number for Modbus/TCP is 502. It is possible to use a 
different port, provided both client and server can be set to use a different 
port number. In some cases, this isn't possible, and in most cases other cases
it is most convenient to just use the standard port number. </p>

<p>With most operating systems, ports numbers less than 1024 are reserved for 
standard system services such as e-mail servers, web servers, etc. and are not
available to ordinary applications. This poses a problem with Modbus/TCP. Either 
the Modbus/TCP server needs to gain (temporarily at least) elevated priviledges, 
or else the incoming messages on port 502 need to be re-routed to a different 
port. The second choice is often the simplest, and poses the fewest security risks. 
</p>

<p>However, it is important to note that if you <em>don't</em> need to use the
Modbus server, or if you <em>do</em> need it but can run it on an alternate
port number, then you don't need to redirect the port. If the remote client is
capable of using an alternate port, that is usually the best solution. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Redirecting Port 502 on Linux:</h2>

<p>Linux has a built-in facility called "iptables" which can be used to block, 
re-route and redirect communications. Redirecting traffic arriving on port 
502 to a different can easily be done by using iptables. For example, to 
redirect incoming traffic on port 502 to port 8502:
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 502 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8502

</pre>


<p>Depending upon how security is set up on your distro, you may need to either 
log in as "root", or (preferably) use "sudo". For example:</p>


<pre class="examples">

	sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 502 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8502

</pre>


<p>To save this change permanently so that it is automatically loaded when the
computer boots up (assuming you use sudo and have nano installed): </p>

<pre class="examples">

	iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 502 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8502 <br>
	sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules" <br>
	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

</pre>


<p>The above example ends with starting the nano editor (you can use a 
different editor if you wish) to edit the "interfaces" file. This file stores
the Ethernet configuration. Add the following line to the end of the section 
for the Ethernet port which will be used for Modbus/TCP (typically "eth0"). </p>

<pre class="examples">

	pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules

</pre>


<p>Save the configuation file and exit nano. Now Ethernet packets coming from
<strong>outside</strong> the computer to port 502 will be redirected to port 8502. 
However, packets originating <strong>inside</strong> the same computer (e.g. 'localhost')
will not be redirected. Anything originating on the same computer will need to be
sent to port 8502.  
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Port 502 on Microsoft Windows:</h2>

<p>Microsoft Windows does not offer any built-in security for system ports,
so port 502 can be used directly without redirection. However, if you are
using any server (on any port), you may need to adjust the firewall (if
one is installed) to allow incoming connections. </p>
