<h1>Help - Installing Third Party Support Software</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>The system is built on a number of third party packages which must be
installed separately before the system will function. These third party
packages are: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Python - Run time language support for the Python programming language. </li>
	<li>Twisted - Networking library. </li>
</ul>

<p>Several additional packages are required for MS Windows (these are not 
required for Linux). 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>pywin32 - Additional Python library (required for MS	Windows only).</li>
	<li>setuptools - Additional library required to install "egg" format 
		libraries (required for additional libraries).</li>
	<li>zope.interface - An additional library required for Twisted (for Twisted
		versions 10.0.0 or later).</li>
</ul>

<p>All required third party support packages are free and can be obtained from 
normal secure internet sites (see below).
</p>

<p>The system has been tested with Python version 2.6. Other versions 
may work but have not been tested. However, version 2.6 is the recommended 
version. The version of Twisted installed must be compatible with the version 
of Python used. If you are using Linux, the version compatibility will be 
taken care of automatically. If you are using MS Windows, the Twisted web 
site will indicate which version of Twisted you need for which version of 
Python.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Obtaining and Installing Third Party Software:</h2>

<p>The required third party software can be obtained from the following 
locations.
</p>

<h3>For Linux:</h3>

<p>For Linux, all required packages can normally be obtained from your 
distro's package repository. Use your package manager (e.g. Synaptic)
to download the packages. Some packages (e.g. Python) may already be
installed as part of the standard OS distribution. 
</p>

<p>Install the following in the order listed:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Python - Version 2.6. </li>
	<li>Twisted. The Debian package name is "python-twisted". You will need
	python-twisted, python-twisted-core, python-twisted-web (not web2), and
	any dependencies (your package manager should be able to figure the
	dependencies out by itself). </li>
</ol>


<h3>For MS Windows:</h3>

<p>Installing software on MS Windows is traditionally more difficult
that with Linux, as MS Windows has no package management or repository
system. This means that each package must be downloaded and installed
separately. However, this is relatively straight forward if you 
follow the steps below.
</p>

<p>The packages can be obtained from the following locations (don't install
them just yet though):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Python - http://Python.org</li>
	<li>pywin32 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</li>
	<li>Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/</li>
	<li>SetupTools - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</li>
	<li>Zope Interface - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you have obtained all the software, install it in the 
following order:
</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Python</strong>. Make a note of where you installed this, as the 
	other packages will need to find it. (Note, the actual install screen will
	look slightly different from the one shown below. This screen shot was taken
	after the install was run once already). Run the installer and follow
	the instructions in the install menus.
	<p><img src="PythonInstall.png" width="400" alt="Python">
	</p></li>

	<li><strong>pywin32</strong>. Run the installer and follow the instructions 
	in the install menus.
	<p><img src="Pywin32Install.png" width="500" alt="Pywin32">
	</p></li>

	<li><strong>SetupTools</strong>. Run the installer and follow the instructions 
	in the install menus. This is required only for installing Zope Interface. If
	Zope Interface is already installed (or you do not require it because you are
	installing an older version of Twisted), you can skip this step.
	<p><img src="SetupTools.png" width="500" alt="SetupTools">
	</li>

	<li><strong>Zope Interface</strong>. This is required for versions of 
	Twisted from 10.0.0 or later. Earlier versions of Twisted package Zope Interface
	in the Twisted package and do not require Zope Interface to be installed
	separately. Zope Interface must be installed using the command 
	line. Move the Zope Interface "egg" package to a working directory and open 
	a command line window in the resulting directory. 
	Type 
	"c:\python26\python c:\python26\Lib\site-packages\easy_install.py zope.interface-3.5.3-py2.6-win32.egg"
	(without the quotes). 
	If you are using a different version of the Zope Interface, the file name 
	"zope.interface-3.5.3-py2.6-win32.egg" may be slightly different.
	If you have installed Python in a different location, or
	if you have installed a different version, you will have to alter the 
	"c:\python26" part of the command accordingly.
	(e.g. "c:\python25\python etc." if you are using Python 2.5).
	<p><img src="Zope1.png" width="600" alt="Zope1"></p>
	You should see something like the following as a result.
	You may see some "deprecation warnings", depending on what version you 
	install. These are not serious and are simply warning of new features or 
	features that will be changed in an upcoming version.
	<p><img src="Zope2.png" width="600" alt="Zope2"></p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Twisted</strong>.  Run the installer and follow the instructions 
	in the install menus.
	<p><img src="TwistedInstall.png" width="400" alt="Twisted"></p>
	</li>

</ol>

<h3>MS Windows DLL Files:</h3>

<p>Some copies of MS-Windows may have one or more "dll" files missing which 
prevent the program from operating correctly. This can happen when dll files are 
unintentionally removed when uninstalling software or making other changes. 
One dll in particular to check is "mfc71.dll". This is a standard MS Windows 
library which is used by many programs. This should be in the "c:\windows\system32" 
directory. If it is missing, you will need to reinstall it. A search on Google 
will turn up many solutions for this problem (this is a common problem). This 
file is not necessary for Linux. 
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Installing on Mac OS/X:</h2>

<p>There is no documentation for installing on Mac OS/X. However, newer 
versions of OS/X may come with Python and Twisted already installed. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Testing Third Party Software:<a name="Testing Third Party Software"></a></h2>

<p>To test if the third party software installation is working, you can do the 
following (you can skip this step if you wish).
</p>

<h3>For Linux:</h3>

<p>For Linux, open a command line terminal and type "python". You should see the
Python interpreter start up with something like the following:
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	Python 2.6.2 (release26-maint, Apr 19 2009, 01:58:18) 
	[GCC 4.3.3] on linux2
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>


<p>To test if twisted is installed, type the following into the Python interpreter:
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	import twisted

</pre>

<p>If it is already installed, the Python command problem will appear after a brief
delay. If it is not already installed, you should get an error which looks 
something like the following:
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
	ImportError: No module named twisted
	>>> 

</pre>


<p>You should get a result similar to that described for twisted.
</p>

<p>To exit Python, press "control-D" (press the control and "d" keys simultaneously).
To close the terminal, press "control-D" again.
</p>


<h3>For MS Windows:</h3>


<p>For MS-Windows, following the instructions given above for Linux, with the 
following exceptions.
</p>

<p>When starting Python, you will need to include the full path name to the Python
interpreter. For example: "C:\Python26\python"
</p>

<p>Test if twisted is installed correctly by using the following commands:
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	import twisted.internet

</pre>


<p>This checks the pywin32 installation as well as twisted.
</p>


<p>To exit Python, press "control-Z" (press the control and "z" keys simultaneously).  
</p>

<hr>

<h2>SimpleJSON</h2>

<p>Older versions offered the option of using an improved JSON library called
"simplejson". This is no longer used as Python 2.6 has JSON support built 
directly into its standard library.  
</p>

<p>If you are using an older version of Python, the system will automatically 
import a bundled version of "simplejson" but without the performance 
optimisations of the 'C' version. However, this will make little measureable 
difference in normal applications.    
</p>
