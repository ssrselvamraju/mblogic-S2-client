<h1>Help - Installing the Base Application</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>The application is distributed as a source archive file. For most platforms
(including Linux), this is a "tar.gz" file. For MS-Windows, this is a "zip" 
file. The MS-Windows version has the special new-line character combination 
(CR-LF) required by that platform, but is otherwise identical to 
the standard version. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Installation:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Select or create a directory into which to extract the application files.</li>
	<li>Extract the archive file into the desired location. </li>
	<li>Several sub-directories will be created as part of the extraction
	process. </li>
	<li>The application itself will now be installed. However, you cannot run it
	until you install the third party support software (see the help instructions
	on how to perform that step). </li>
</ol>


<hr>

<h2>Application Directory Contents:</h2>

<p>You should see the following items present in the application directory.
</p>

<h3>Application Directory Contents:</h3>

<p>There will be a directory called "mblogic". It will contain a number of 
files with ".py" extensions. These are part of the application program 
itself. These files will be automatically compiled to ".pyc" files when 
the application first starts. There will also be several sub-directories
with additional code files, as well as html web pages for the help system
and the status monitorin system. There is nothing in these directories
that you will need to change.
</p>

<h3>HMI Directory Contents:</h3>

<p>There will be a directory called "hmipages". It will contain a number
of files with ".xhtml", ".js", ".css", and ".png" extensions. These files
constitute a sample HMI client (web page) that comes with the system.
You will replace some of these files with your own versions later if you create 
your own HMI application. 
</p>

<h3>Sample Soft Logic Program:</h3>

<p>There will be several files which are provided as a sample soft
logic application. This sample application works with the sample
HMI client (web page). These files are: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>"plcprog.txt". This is a sample soft logic	program. </li>
	<li>"mbserver.config". This is provided as a sample server communication
	configuration file. You will need this file to use the sample HMI demo.
	You will also need it to access the on-line help functions and system
	status functions until you replace it with your own configuration. </li>
	<li>"mbclient.config". This is provided as a sample client communication
	configuration file. You will need this file to use the sample HMI demo. </li>
	<li>"mblogic.config". This is provided as a sample soft logic IO configuration
	file. You will need this file to run the sample soft logic program and to use
	the HMI demo. </li>
	<li>"mbhmi.config". This is provided as a sample HMI server configuration
	file. You will need this file to use the HMI demo. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Shell Script to Start the System:</h3>

<p>There will also be a shell script which is used to start the system. For
the Linux version, this is called "mblogic.sh". For the MS-Windows version, this
is called "mblogic.bat". This file simply calls the main program file in the
"mblogic" directory.
