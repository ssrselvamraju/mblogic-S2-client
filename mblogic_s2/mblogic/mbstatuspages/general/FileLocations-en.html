<h1>Help - File Locations</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>This help topic describes the names and locations of important system files. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>System Files Location:</h2>

<p>The system program files are located in a subdirectory called "mblogic".
The system expects this sub-directory to be located in (branching off from) 
the  "current directory" (the directory from which the application was started).
If the directory is <em><strong>not</strong></em> located in the expected
place, the web servers which provide the on-line help and status information
will not be able to find the directories where the web pages are stored.  
</p>

<p>When you are starting the program, make sure that you are in the correct 
directory before starting the program. If you start it using the provided
shell script or batch file, this should not be a problem. If you are creating
your own start up method, be sure to change into the correct directory 
before starting the program.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Configuration Files and Soft Logic Program:</h2>

<p>The system expects to find the configuration files and the soft 
logic program in the "current directory".  
</p>

<h3>Application File Locations:</h3>
<p>
<img src="AppFiles.png" width="500" alt="Application Files">
</p>

<p>These files are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>mbserver.config</strong> - This configures the server 
	communications connections, including the on-line help server and the 
	status system server. The system will not function without a correct 
	configuration.</li>

	<li><strong>mbclient.config</strong> - This configures the client 
	communications connections.</li>

	<li><strong>mbhmi.config</strong> - This configures the server functions
	for the HMI. The HMI system will not function without a correct configuration.
	The communications port number used by the HMI server however, is set
	in "mbserver.config". </li>

	<li><strong>mblogic.config</strong> - This configures the exchange of data
	between the soft logic system and the other components in the system. The
	soft logic system will not function without a correct configuration. </li>

	<li><em><strong>Soft logic program</strong></em> - The name of the file
	used for the soft logic program is user configurable via the 
	mblogic.config file. There is no default name for this file. The system
	ships with a sample program called "plcprog.txt". However, any file name
	and any file extension can be used, provided it does not conflict with
	the name used by one of the other expected files. For example, "MACH021.plcpgr"
	is a valid name. </li>

	<li><strong>mblogic.dtable</strong> - This is a system file which is used to
	store data table values. This permits data table values to be restored after
	a system restart. Details on this feature may be found in the help section
	on "Soft Logic". This file is automatically created on start up and the 
	size of the file depends on the soft logic configuration.</li>

	<li><strong>alarms.db</strong> - This is a system file which stores the 
	database with alarm history and events. This file will be automatically
	created on start up if it is not already present. The file will grow in 
	size as more alarm history and events are added. The amount of space 
	required to store a record will depend on the length (number of characters) 
	of the alarm and event tags configured, as well as the client id (the name 
	of the client is stored as part of the alarm acknowledgement). However, 
	typically 100,000 alarms history records and 100,000 events will occupy 
	10 MB of disk space. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Backup Files:</h3>

<p>When configuration files are edited via the configuration forms, the old
versions are saved with a ".back" extension. For example, "mbhmi.config" will
be saved as "mbhmi.config.back". 
</p>

<hr>


<h2>HMI Files:</h2>

<p>The system expects to find the HMI client files in a directory called 
<em><strong>hmipages</strong></em> branching off from the "current directory".
The HMI client web page can have any name. The HMI web server will fetched any
page in that directory requested by the user. This includes any Javascript, CSS,
PNG, and other files which are named in the web page.   
</p>

<h3>HMI File Locations:</h3>
<p>
<img src="HMIFiles.png" width="500" alt="HMI Files">
</p>

<p>Since the HMI web server will serve any web pages, user generated web pages
for purposes other than HMI can also be placed in this directory. For example,
equipment manuals and operator instructions can also be served from this
directory. However, a dedicated web server for user documentation is also
provided (see below).
</p>

<p>The standard Javascript library files are located in the application 
directory in a subdirectory called "hmilib". The HMI system will automatically 
search for them there. 
</p>

<p>Any subdirectories which are created in the <em>hmipages</em> directory will 
be ignored, and any files located in any such subdirectories will not be able 
to be served by the integrated HMI web server. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>RSS Files:</h2>

<p>If you use the RSS monitor feature you will need two files which must be 
placed in the <em>hmipages</em> directory. These are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>rsstemplate.xml</strong></li>
	<li><strong>rsseventtexts.js</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These files must be in the <em>hmipages</em> directory and have those exact 
names.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>User Help Pages:</h2>

<p>The system includes a simple web server that can be used to host user created
web pages for purposes such as equipment manuals, operating procedures, etc. 
The system expects to find these files in a directory called 
<em><strong>mbhelppages</strong></em> branching off from the "current directory".
The web pages themselves can have any name. The help web server will fetched any
page in that directory requested by the user. This includes any Javascript, CSS,
PNG, and other files which are referenced by the web pages.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Generic Clients:</h2>

<p>Generic clients are stored in the <em><strong>genclient</strong></em> 
directory.
</p>
