<h1>Help - On Line Help</h1>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>The on-line help system includes a set of web help pages which can be accessed 
through a built in web server. The on-line help includes information on installation, 
configuration, programming, and trouble shooting. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Accessing On Line Help:</h2>

<p>To access the help system, you must know the IP address of the computer 
where the system was installed. If your web browser is running on the same 
computer, you can use the address "localhost" (which is the standard address 
name a computer has for itself). The "home page" for the help system is called 
"index.html" (this is also a standard convention).
</p>

<p>The following shows two different examples:
</p>
<pre class="examples">

	http://192.168.50.10:8080/index.html

	http://localhost:8080/index.html

</pre>


<p>The on-line help system is part of the web based status monitoring and 
control system. The port number used is set in the configuration system. 
The port used in the sample configuration shipped with the system is 8080. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Help System Menus:</h2>

<p>The help system is integrated into the status monitoring and control system.
Each status monitoring and control web page has a link to the main help web 
page via a menu option titled "Help". Click on that menu item to view the
main help web page. Each help web page includes the status monitoring menu
allowing you to return to the status monitoring system at any time.
</p>

<p>Each help web page contains a series of links to help topics on the left side
of the page. Click on any of these links to see more details on that topic. Below
the help topic links are further links to details on the particular help topic
being viewed. These detailed help links will change as different topics are 
viewed. 
</p>

<h2>What to do if the Help System is Disabled:</h2>

<p>As shipped, the help system uses port 8080 for the help web server. However, 
the user has the ability to assign a different port number, or to disable the 
web server altogether. If the web server is disabled, the user will not be 
able to access the on line help (or the status monitoring system). If you 
wish to re-enable the web server, make sure the following lines are in the 
configuration file.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	# Status web server.
	[status]
	type=tcpserver
	protocol=status
	port=8080

</pre>


<p>The configuration file is an ordinary text file and can be edited with any 
text editor. You may use a different port number if you wish. Just remember that 
your web browser will need to look for this alternate port number if you use it. 
</p>
