<h1>Help - Creating an Application</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>The system can be used in a variety of applications. This section will present
an example using all the components together to control a simple machine.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Create the Application:</h2> 


<h3>Allocate the System Data Table Memory:</h3>

<p>The communications, soft logic, and HMI systems connect with each other 
using the system data table. before creating a new application it is necessary
to allocate space in the system data table for data that needs to be read from
or written to field devices, communications fault monitoring addresses, and
for data that needs to be exchanged between the soft logic system and the
HMI (this also goes through the system data table). 
</p>

<p>A good layout for the system data table will make configuration of the
rest of the system easier. The soft logic system has its own data table and
addressing system, so you can change the arrangement of data in the system
data table without affecting the soft logic program or the HMI (their
configurations can be adjusted to suit).
</p>

<h3>Enable the System Servers:</h3>

<p>In order to be able to interact with the system, we need to enable the
basic system servers. We will want the following features available to us:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>On line help. This gives us access to the on line help. </li>
	<li>System status and control. This gives us access to reports on the
	current status of the system. It also provides access to error messages
	for configuration problems, and it allows us to alter the configuration and
	soft logic program while the system is running. </li>
	<li>Modbus/TCP server. This enables the server (slave) protocol so that other
	clients (masters) can communicate with this system.</li>
	<li>HMI. This will allow us to create a web based HMI. </li>
	<li>ERP web service protoco. This will provide a web service protocol which
	allows an MRP/ERP to communicate with our machine to obtain production data.</li>
</ul>


<p>Information on creating a configuration is located in the section on 
"Communications". A sample configuration is also provided with the system. 
</p>


<h3>Configure Communications with Field IO:</h3>

<p>A normal application will require communicating with field IO such as valves,
sensors, drives, etc. These field devices are normally servers ("slaves").
The system create a separate client connection for each field device server. 
Each client connection can execute multiple commands in sequence. This permits
communications with each field device to take place in parallel, rather than
communicating with each one at a time. This means that a slow or faulty field
device will not hold up communications with other field devices. 
</p>

<p>When a client connection executes a "read" command, it will read data from
a field device (remote address) and store it in the local system data table. 
When a client connection executes a "write" command, it will read data from
the local system data table and write it to the remote field device. The HMI
and soft logic systems will have access to this data through the system
data table.
</p>

<p>Information on creating a configuration is located in the section on 
"Communications". A sample configuration is also provided with the system. 
</p>

<p>Each field device server (slave) that you wish to communicate with requires
its own client connection configuration.  
</p>


<h3>Write the Soft Logic Program:</h3>

<p>The soft logic (PLC) program determines what your machine or process will 
do. The system uses conventional PLC type instructions operating on a 
conventional data table. The soft logic data table is separate from the
system data table.  
</p>

<p>See the help sections on "Soft Logic" for more information on programming,
addressing, and the instruction set.
</p>

<h3>Configure the Soft Logic IO:</h3>

<p>Since the system and soft logic data tables are separate, it is necessary
to copy data between them in order for the soft logic program to have access
to the field devices or HMI. This also permits the soft logic addresses to be
in a different order and spacing from that used in the system data table.
</p>

<p>The transfer of data between the system and soft logic addresses is controlled
by a configuration file. The soft logic "IO" system can read and write to and
from any addresses in the system and soft logic data table. See the help sections 
on "Soft Logic" for more information on soft logic IO configuration.
</p>


<h3>Write the HMI Web Page:</h3>

<p>The HMI system is web based. An HMI "screen" is just a web page. See the help 
sections on "HMI" for more information on HMI pages.
</p>

<p>The system is designed to communicate with multiple HMI web pages 
simultaneously. These can be multiple copies of the same web page, or
copies of different web pages. This means that a machine or process
can have multiple HMI panels if desired. 
</p>

<p>If you wish to use the RSS feed feature, you will also need to configure 
the RSS feed template. 
</p>

<h3>Create the HMI Server Configuration:</h3>

<p>When the HMI client (web page) communicates with the server, it requests 
information in "tag label" addresses, rather than the Modbus addresses used
by the system data table. The HMI server must translate between the "tag"
names used by the HMI client and the numerical addresses used by the system
data table. For example, "PB1" may be stored in coil address "100", and "PB2" 
may be stored in coil address 25. Tag labels are associated with system data
table addresses by means of a configuration file.  See the help sections on 
"HMI" for more information on HMI configuration. 
</p>

<h3>Load the Configurations and Programs:</h3>

<p>Once the configurations, program, and web page(s) have been created, 
they need to be loaded into the system. The communications configuration
can only be changed by stopping and restarting the entire system. The other
(soft logic configuration and program, HMI configuration, HMI web pages) can
(except for a few items) be reloaded while the system is running.
</p>

<h3>Debugging and Troubleshooting:</h3>

<p>The current configurations can be viewed using the status system web
interface. The status system also allows any address (or set of addresses) to
be inspected while the system is running. For more information on using the
status system consult the on line help pages included with the status system.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Enabling Only Some Features</h3>

<p>The system is designed to be modular. If you do not require certain features
you do not have to enable or configure them. For example, if you only want the
communications platform and do not require the soft logic or HMI features, you
can simply not configure them and the system will operate without them.
