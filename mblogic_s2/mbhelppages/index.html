<h1>User Help</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>This is a placeholder page which you can replace with your own web pages to
add custom on-line documentation for your project. You can replace all or any 
of the existing contents of the user help directory with your own web pages
and graphics and they will be served by the integrated help web server. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Looking for the Old Help System?</h2> 

<p>The on-line system help web pages are now integrated into the status 
display and control system. See the installation documentation for more 
information on how to access the status display and control system.
