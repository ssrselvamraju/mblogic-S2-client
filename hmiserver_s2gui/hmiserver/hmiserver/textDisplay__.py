%s, %s
This module diplays Text Instructions on the HMI screen based on different states of the robot. Text is written to holding resiter 100 to 100+lenght of string storing 1 character in each register.
Just like the standard clients this client has to be started with the command line parameters (which are supposed to be the same as those in the MBClient and this program should run on the same computer that runs the standard client.

Any parameters which are not specified will use their default values. 
These include:

-p Port number of HMI web server. The default is 8082.
-h Name or address of remote server. The default is localhost.
-r Port number of remote server. The default is 502.
-u Unit ID of remote server. The default is 1. (This is Modbus specific).
-t Timeout for communications. The default is 5.0 seconds.
-e hElp. (this screen).

This program is automatically setup to get the command line parameters sent to the standard MBClient and none of the above parameters need to be passed to this program seperately.
