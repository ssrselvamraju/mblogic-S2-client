<h1>Help - Field Device Communications Basics</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>HMIServer communicates with field devices such as I/O modules or PLCs
by using the communications protocol which is native to that device. This
section deals with the basics of field device communications and the
protocols which are supported by HMIServer.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Field Device Protocols:</h2> 

<p>HMIServer supports the following field device protocols:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/modbusbasics-en.html">Modbus/TCP</a></li>
	<li><a href="/sbusbasics-en.html">SAIA SBus</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Click on the links above to read more details about these particular 
protocols.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Client/Server or Master/Slave:</h2>

<p>Most protocols use a client/server model. This is also sometimes referred 
to as <em>master/slave</em>. A "master" is the same thing as a "client", while 
a "slave" is the same thing as a "server". The master/slave terms originated 
in industry, while the client/server terms originated in the computer 
industry. The different terms arose due to historical differences as to how 
they were being applied, but the computer industry terms have to a large 
degree replaced the industrial terms as industary has adopted more off the 
shelf computer technology.
</p>

<p>A client/server protocol operates as follows:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The client sends a <em>request</em>.</li>
	<li>The server receives the request.</li>
	<li>The server processes the request and returns a <em>response</em>.</li>
	<li>The client receives the response, and the transaction (communications 
		cyle) is complete.</li>
	<li>The client may then send another request.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, when you use a web browser to view a web page on the internet, 
your web browser sends a "page request" to the web server. The web server
decodes the request and sends back a web page as a "response". Your e-mail
client program fetches your e-mail in the same way from a mail server.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Ethernet:</h2>

<p>"Ethernet" is the most widely used network communications media. However,
Ethernet by itself is not a communications protocol. Instead, additional 
protocol layers are added on top of Ethernet. 
</p>

<h3>IP Addresses</h3>

<p>An "IP address" is the network address of the device which the message is
being sent to. Each device on a network must have a unique IP address. The 
number of possible IP addresses is very large (billions of addresses).  
</p>

<h3>TCP Versus UDP</h3>

<p>Layered on top of IP, there are two main additional layers - TCP and UDP.
When TCP is used, the IP communications software "stack" establishes a 
"connection" between two points and messages are sent between these end
points. When UDP is used, no "connection" is established before a message is
sent.
</p>  

<p>This "connection" is not a physical connection. All it means is that the
IP software "stack" (or operating system) will track where the messages are
intended to go, and will automatically re-send them if they don't arrive.
With UDP there is no virtual "connection", so the application program needs
to do any message tracking itself.  
</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that UPD is "faster" than "TCP' because there is less
message tracking overhead involved. However, IP software "stacks" are usually
highly optimised and so are very fast and efficient. The details of the field 
device protocols themselves are usually have far more influence on speed or 
efficiency than thc choice of TCP or UDP.      
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Server Ports</h2>

<h3>Port Numbers</h3>

<p>In addition to the IP address, the "port number" is required. An Ethernet
"port number" does not refer to the physical connector. A port number is an 
number send in the Ethernet header used by the operating system or firmware 
in a device to determine which program a message should be sent to. This 
allows multiple programs to share the same Ethernet adaptor without conflict.
When a client sends a message, it sends it specifies a particular port number. 
When the message is recieved by the server, the operating system or firmware
will look at the port number and route the message to the correct program.
</p>

<h3>Binding to Ports</h3>

<p>When a server program starts up it will "bind to a port". That simply means
that it will ask the operating system to be assigned a particular port
number. Only one server may bind to the same port number at any time. If the 
port number is already in use by another program the new server program will not
be allowed to use it, and will encounter an error. When a server program shuts
down, it frees the use of the port. The operating system will then wait for a
certain time-out to pass (the standard is 70 seconds) before allowing that
port number to be used again. 
</p>

<h3>Alternate Ports</h3>

<p>Most protocols will have a port number which they expect applications to 
use. However, it is usually possible to use an alternate port number provided
both the client and the server can be instructed to use it. The reasons for
using a different port number are usually related to avoiding conflicts with
other programs using that port (including running multiple copies of the same
program on the same computer), problems with firewalls, or avoiding security
problems.   
</p>

<p>Operating systems such as Linux have features which allow ports to be 
"remapped" such that the port actually used by the application is different
from the port which it appears to be using from the outside. This can be
used to operate the program on an alternate port number, while still making
it appear from the outside to use the "standard" port.  
</p>

<h3>TCP/IP Ports Versus UDP/IP Ports</h3>

<p>TCP/IP and UDP/IP port numbers are independent of each other. This means
it is possible for two different programs to use the same port number, provided
that one is a TCP port while the other is a UDP port.  
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Field Device Application Protocols</h2>

<p>The actual industrial field device protocol is layered on top of TCP/IP 
or UDP/IP. This is the "application layer" protocol. It is this protocol layer 
which determines whether two devices can communicate with each other. A good
analogy is is a telephone system. You may be able to connect to someone on a
telephone, but unless you can both understand the same language, no real 
communications can take place. 
</p>

<p>Examples of field device application protocols include Modbus/TCP and
SAIA Ether SBus.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>HTTP or the "Web" Protocol</h2>

<p>Web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, or Opera use a protocol called "HTTP"
(Hyper Text Transport Protocol). This is a client/server protocol which is most
commonly used to transmit web pages between web servers and web browsers. A 
"web server" is simply a server program which understands the HTTP protocol
and can use it to send data. The data may simply be files containing web
pages, or the data may be created entirely "on the fly" in response to a 
request, or it may be a combination of the two.  
</p>

<p>When a web browser receives a web page from web server from a web server, it
will examine the web page to see if it has links to additional files. These 
links may include images (e.g. PNG files), Javascript program files, style
sheets, or other content. If it sees these links, it will then ask the web
browser for this additional content. 
</p>

<p>As well as web browsers, other programs can use HTTP to request data from 
a web server. Indeed, there are many instances where the intended recipient is
not an ordinary web browser. If the data is organised in a way that it 
constitutes another application protocol on top of HTTP, this is known as
a "web service protocol". Web service protocols are used in many applications 
which involve interfacing different systems together, and many of the protocols
involved tend to be ad hoc and application specific. 
</p>

<p>When a web browser runs a program (including a Javascript program) which
opens up an independent communications channel to load data from the web 
server independently of loading the web page itself, this is called "AJAX" 
(Asynchronous Javascript And XML). Despite the name, the data does not need
to be formatted using XML to be considered AJAX. The HMI system used in 
HMIServer uses AJAX techniques to continuously refresh the data in the web
page without reloading the page itself.
