<h1>Help - Modbus Basics</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 

<p>Modbus is the leading industrial open control protocol. This help page will
discuss some of the basic concepts and correct some common misconceptions, but
does not provide a detailed description of the protocol itself.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Types of Modbus:</h2> 

<p>Modbus comes in several different types, depending upon the media over
which it is transported.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Modbus RTU - This is original Modbus. It is used over RS-232 and RS-485
		links. </li>
	<li>Modbus ASCII - This is similar to Modbus RTU, but the data is encoded
		in ASCII instead of raw binary. This version is mainly used over radio
		links. </li>
	<li>Modbus/TCP - This version is used over Ethernet. It is similar to Modbus
		RTU, but uses the check-sum built into Ethernet rather than including 
		the RTU check sum. </li>
	<li>Modbus over Ethernet - This is a vague term used by some vendors, but
		is not an officially recognised name. It is often used to refer to
		tunnelling Modbus RTU over Ethernet between two points using special
		hardware. This is <em>not</em> part of the Modbus standard and  the
		format is vendor dependent. </li>
	<li>Modbus/UDP - This is similar to Modbus/TCP but uses UDP Ethernet sockets 
		instead of TCP sockets. This is offered by some vendors, but is 
		<em>not</em> part of the Modbus standard. </li>
	<li>Modbus+ - This is a proprietary protocol which uses the Modbus name, but
		doesn't follow the Modbus communications standard. This is rarely 
		encountered. </li>
</ul>

<p>MBLogic uses Modbus/TCP.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Communications</h2> 

<h3>Client/Server or Master/Slave:</h3>

<p>Like most communications protocols, Modbus uses a <em>client/server</em> type 
protocol. This is also sometimes referred to as <em>master/slave</em>. A 
"master" is the same thing as a "client", while a "slave" is the same thing as 
a "server". Typically, the client is the PLC or controller, while the server 
is a field device such as a valve bank or sensor block.
</p>

<h3>Unit ID:</h3>

<p>A Modbus message includes what is called the <em>unit ID</em>. A unit ID 
is a number between 0 and 255 which is used to identify the server (or slave)
address in RS-232 or RS-485 networks. Each server (slave) is assigned a
"slave ID" number and listens for messages which contain this number in
the unit ID field.
</p>

<p>Modbus/TCP also has the unit ID in its messages, but the Ethernet TCP/IP 
address is used to decide where to actually delivery the message. Many or most
server devices will ignore the unit ID. However, some will use the unit ID to
decide whether to forward the message out a built-in serial port. This message
forwarding allows older RS-485 devices to be used on newer Ethernet networks.
However, support for this feature is only found in a few devices.   
</p>

<h3>Message ID:</h3>

<p>When a Modbus message sends a request, it includes a <em>message ID</em>
number. This is a number from 0 to 65,535. This number is normally incremented
by the client for each request (and allowed to roll over to 0 again when it 
overflows). This message ID is echoed back by the server. The client can use 
this message ID number to determine if any messages are being lost or delayed
in transmission.
</p>

<h3>Serial Communications Parameters:</h3>

<p>When used over RS-232 or RS-585 networks, the usual serial communications
parameters such as baud rate, parity, stop bits, etc. must be set correctly
for all devices. Setting of these parameters is not dicussed here. Consult
your vendor documentation for details. 
</p>

<h3>Ethernet Parameters:</h3>

<p>Modbus/TCP uses TCP/IP communicate over Ethernet. The "standard" port 
number for Modbus/TCP is port 502. However, it is possible to run
Modbus/TCP on alternate port numbers provided that all devices that are 
participating in the communications can be configured to use the alternate
port.   
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Modbus Data Representation:</h2> 

<h3>Data Table</h3>

<p>Modbus uses the concept of a <em>data table</em> to refer to data. Data 
tables should be familiar to anyone who has used a PLC. A data table is an 
array or block of memory used to store data. Data is referenced using data 
table addresses. Modbus data table addresses come in four types.   
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Discrete inputs - These are read only boolean values. They are typically
		used to represent sensor inputs and other boolean values which are
		read but not written to by the user. </li>
	<li>Coils - These are read-write boolean values. They are typically used to
		represent outputs (e.g. valve solenoids) or internal bits which are
		both read by and written to by the user. </li>
	<li>Input registers - These are read only 16 bit integers. They are typically
		used to represent analogue input values and other integer values which
		are read but not written to by the user.</li>
	<li>Holding registers - These are read-write 16 bit integers. They are 
		typically used to represent analogue outputs or internal numbers which are
		both read by and written to by the user. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the native data types of boolean and integer, it is possible
to store large integers, floating point numbers, and strings in a Modbus data
table by splitting the data over several registers. However, Modbus does not
offer any direct support for this, so the user is responsible for splitting
the values up and storing them in separate locations. 
</p>

<h3>Data Table Addresses</h3>

<p>Modbus data table addresses are simply integer numbers. Each address type 
(discrete input, coil, input register, holding register) has its own numbered 
set of addresses. For example, discrete input 42 and coil 42 are two separate 
addresses.
</p>

<p>Modbus distinguishes between the <em>protocol</em> address and the 
<em>data model</em> address. The addresses that are used in the protocol
are numbered from 0 to 65,535. However, vendor documentation may number from 
1 to 65,536. This documentation will refer to the <em>protocol</em> addresses
(that is the first address is 0). 
</p>

<p>Although it is possible to have 65,536 addresses of each type the number 
of addresses actually implemented in a particular device (sensor block, valve 
bank, PLC, etc.) is usually much less that this. Each device designer is
responsible for deciding what makes sense for their application. They will
then normally supply a "memory map" or list of addresses for their device
listing what addresses were implemented, and what each one does.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to "overlay" address types. That is, it is possible
to design a device such that several different address types all refer to the
same physical memory location. For example, it is possible to have holding
register 10 and input register 10 both be the same memory location. In this 
case if you were to write to holding register 10, the value would also appear
in input register 10. The same applies to coils and discrete inputs.
</p>

<p>In the same way, it is possible to pack coils and discrete inputs in 
registers. For example, coils 0 to 15 could be packed in holding register
0, coils 16 to 31 in holding register 1, etc. This would allow multiple
coils to be read (or written to) as words.
</p>

<p>Although overlay of data types and packing of coils into registers is
possible, it is not often found in practice.
</p>


<h3>Some Common Misconceptions about Modbus Addresses</h3>

<p>According to the Modbus standard, addresses are simply integers from 0 to
65,535 with the different address ranges being referred to as coils, holding
registers, etc. However, some vendors will document their hardware using 
numerical prefixes which are not actually part of the Modbus address. This
originated from some models of PLCs which used the Modbus communications
protocol, and which also used numerical prefixes in their internal data
table. This is similar to using "I", "Q", "V", etc. as address prefixes in IEC 
type PLCs.  
</p>

<p>However, it is important to remember that these numerical prefixes
are documentation methods and are <em>not</em> part of what the Modbus protocol 
itself sends as part of the messages. A difference in documentation methods does
not affect the compatibility of the protocol itself.
</p>

<p>These prefixes are they mentioned anywhere in the Modbus standard, but the
following shows how they are typically used in documentation based on this
older convention:  
</p>

<ul>
	<li>0xxxx - Coils.</li>
	<li>1xxxx - Discrete inputs.</li>
	<li>3xxxx - Input registers.</li>
	<li>4xxxx - Holding registers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is no 2xxxx address prefix.
</p>

<p>In addition to numerical prefixes, some documentation will refer to protocol 
addresses (addresses start at 0), while other documentation will refer to data 
model addresses (addresses start at 1). That is, the first holding register may
be 0 or 1 (or 40000 versus 40001 using prefixes). However, this has no bearing 
on what gets sent over the wire as a Modbus message. For a Modbus protocol message, 
the lowest address is always "0", not "1". 
</p>

<p>This document uses standard Modbus terms and addresses throughout using 
Modbus protocol addressing without prefixes or offsets. However, if you are 
reading the documentation for sensor blocks, valves, and other devices, you 
must keep in mind that some vendors may document their hardware in different 
ways.
</p>

<h2>Modbus Commands, or "Functions":</h2> 

<h3>Functions:</h3> 

<p>Modbus commands are known as <em>functions</em>. A function is simply a 
command to read or write a data table address. Functions are numbers such as 
1, 2, 3, 4, etc. For example, function "1" will read one or more coils. 
Function "15" will write to one or more coils. All function codes are defined 
as part of the Modbus standard, but which functions were actually implemented 
in any particular device is up to the device designer. For example, a valve bank
may only implement functions for writing coils because that is all that
was necessary for that device.    
</p>

<p>The most common functions are listed below. There are many other functions
defined in the Modbus standard, but these are the ones most commonly 
encountered. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 - Read multiple coils. </li> 
	<li>2 - Read multiple discrete inputs. </li>
	<li>3 - Read multiple holding registers. </li>
	<li>4 - Read multiple input registers. </li>
	<li>5 - Write single coil. </li>
	<li>6 - Write single holding register. </li>
	<li>15 - Write multiple coils. </li>
	<li>16 - Write multiple holding registers. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantity:</h3> 

<p>Modbus functions which read or write multiple addresses will also require
a <em>quantity</em> parameter. The "quantity" parameter specifies the number of
consecutive addresses to read or write.
</p>

<h3>Maximum Number of Addresses Which Can be Read or Written at Once:</h3> 

<p>The modbus protocol specifies the maximum number of addresses which can be 
read or written at one time. This limits the amount of data which must be 
transferred in a single command to no more than 255 bytes. For a read command,
the limit is 2000 coils or discrete inputs or 125 registers. For a write command,
the limit is 1968 coils or 123 registers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Modbus Errors:</h2> 

<h3>Modbus Faults:</h3>

<p>When a Modbus message is received by a server it is analysed to see of all 
the parameters are correct. If everything is OK, the server will send a response.
This response may consist of data, or it may just be an acknowledgement that
the message was received. 
</p>

<p>If there are any error however, the server may do one of two things. If the
message could not be decoded at all (e.g. there was a bad check sum), the message
is simply discarded. If the message could be decoded but one or more parameters
was incorrect (e.g. an attempt was made to read a non-existent address), then 
the server will send a response containing a <em>fault code</em>. The fault 
code is simply the function code from the request with 128 added to it. 
</p>

<p>For example, if the client sends a request with function 3 (read holding
registers) that contains an error, the server will respond with a fault code
of 131 (3 + 128 = 131).
</p>


<h3>Modbus Exceptions:</h3>

<p>In addition to the fault code, the server will return an <em>exception 
code</em> which provides more detail about what was wrong. Exception codes are 
defined individually for each function, but for most common functions the 
following will apply:  
</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 = The requested function code (command) is not supported.</li>
	<li>2 = The address is incorrect (does not exist). For functions which 
		operate on multiple addresses, this check includes all addresses which 
		are affected by the request. </li>
	<li>3 = The quantity of addresses is incorrect. The quantity parameter
		was too large (or was zero) for the function requested. </li>
	<li>4 = Some unspecified error occured in the server which prevented
		the request from being carried out. </li>
</ul>
