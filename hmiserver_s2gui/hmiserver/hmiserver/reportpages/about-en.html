<h1>Help - About</h1>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>This software system is known as HMIServer, and has the following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Includes a built in web based HMI.</li>
	<li>Field device communications drivers are built in.</li>
	<li>Includes extensive on line documentation.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Field Device Communicatinos</h2>

<p>Drivers for field device protocols are built direction into HMIServer and 
do not require any additional software.
</p>


<h3>Supported Protocols</h3>

<p>HMIServer supports the following protocols:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Modbus/TCP</li>
	<li>SAIA Ether SBus</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client and Server:</h3>

<p>HMIServer supports field device protocols in both both client and server 
forms. The client version acts as a client (master) when talking to the 
field device. The server version acts as a server (slave) and must be 
actively polled by the field device. Both versions offer otherwise similar 
capabilties and the choice of which to use depends on whether a client or 
server is needed to work with the field devices. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>System Requirements:</h2>

<p>The software has the following system requirements:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Will run on any computer capable of supporting Python 2.5 or 2.6.</li>
	<li>Hard drive space requirements for the basic software (excluding 
	Python) is approximately five megabytes.</li>
	<li>The required speed for the computer will depend upon the size of the
	HMI program, the number of data items monitored and type of protocols used.
	In typical applications CPU usage is negligible. </li>
</ul>
