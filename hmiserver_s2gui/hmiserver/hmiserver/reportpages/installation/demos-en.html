<h1>Help - Demo Applications:</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>This section describes how to operate the demo which comes with the system.
The demo uses the Modbus/TCP server version of the HMI system as it allows a
self standing demonstration to be created. However, all versions of HMIServer 
support the same HMI features. 
</p>

<hr>


<h2>Process Simulation Program:</h2>

<p>A process simulation program ("demosim.py") is also provided. This
is a simple program which communicates with HMIServer reacts to events which 
occur in HMIServer. This program is started automatically if the instructions 
referenced below are followed. This program has no purpose outside of the demos 
and may be deleted if it is no longer required.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sample Configuration:</h2>

<p>A sample <em>mbhmi.config</em> configuration file is provided in order
to provide a compatible configuration for the demos. This file must be 
replaced by one created by the user when a real application is created. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Server Start Parameters:</h2>

<p>All demo web pages use the following server start parameters:
</p>


<h3>Modbus/TCP Server Version of HMIServer</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>HMIServer Port (-p)</em></strong>: 8082</li>
	<li><strong><em>Modbus/TCP Port (-r)</em></strong>: 8600</li>
</ul>

<p>E.g.:
</p>
<pre class="examples">

	./hmiservermbs/hmiservermbs.py -p 8082 -r 8600

</pre>




<h3>Alternative Parameters</h3>

<p>A different set of parameters may be used provided they are valid. The
web page URLs given in the following documentation however assumes that
the above values have been used. Change the URLs if you are using a different
set of parameters.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Web Browser Compatibility:</h2>

<p>The HMIServer demos use a number of advanced features. Almost all modern
web browsers support these features. However, some web browsers based on
older technologies do not. If the demos do not work correctly, check to make
sure that your browser is an up to date version. The following browsers
are known to work: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Firefox versions 3.0 or newer.</li>
	<li>Opera 9 or newer. (Older versions may work, but have not been tested).</li>
	<li>Apple Safari.</li>
	<li>Google Chrome.</li>
	<li>Epiphany.</li>
	<li>Midori.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to use a newer version of these browsers in order to view the
continuous animation effects in some elements of the demonstration. 
</p>

<p>Note: Microsoft Internet Explorer (any version) will <em>not</em> work.
It is a text-only browser, and does not have the ability to display the 
dynamic graphics used in these demos. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Starting the Demos:</h2>

<p>Several shell scripts or batch files are provided to start the demos using
the default parameters. These are:
</p>


<table class="helptable"  border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Protocol</th>
		<th>Client/Server</th>
		<th>Linux File</th>
		<th>MS Windows File</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Modbus/TCP</td>
		<td>Server</td>
		<td>hmidemombs.sh</td>
		<td>hmidemombs.bat</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<p>These start HMIServer as well as a simple demo process simulator program.
</p>



<h3>Starting the Demo from Linux:</h3>


<p>Do <em>one</em> of the following"</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are using Gnome, double click on the shell script file (see
	above for the file names).</li>
	<li><em>Or</em> from the command line, type the file name. For example:
	"./hmidemombs.sh" file for the Modbus/TCP server version.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Starting the Demo from MS Windows:</h3>


<p>Do <em>one</em> of the following"</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are using the MS-Windows GUI, double click on the 
		batch file (see above for the file names).</li>
	<li><em>Or</em> from the command line, type the name of the
	batch file and press enter.
</ul>


<hr>


<h2>Tank Demo:</h2>

<p>"Tank Demo" demonstrates a number of typical features.
To start tank demo, type the following into your web browser address bar:
</p>


<pre class="examples">

	http://localhost:8082/hmidemo.xhtml

</pre>

<p>You should now see a web page that looks similar to the one shown below.
</p>

	<p><img src="helpmain.png" width="500" height="462" 
				alt="tank screen">
	</p>

<p>Click on the "help" menu option in the demo for an explanation of the
features of the demo.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Access by Multiple Users:</h2>

<p>The system is designed to allow access to the same data by multiple 
simultaneous users. This can allow several HMI displays to control the
system from different locations. You can test this by opening the demo
several times in different browser windows (or tabs). Data which changes in 
one web browser will automatically be seen by the rest. You can test this
by starting the tank demo in one window while watching the changes occur
in real time on the others.
</p>

<p>Multiple access includes access using different web pages. You can design
different HMI web pages for different users and operate them simultaneously.
</p>
